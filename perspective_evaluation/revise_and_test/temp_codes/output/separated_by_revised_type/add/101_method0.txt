although ken barnes is a fucking moron , we need more criticism to balance it out hi , as one of the primary authors of this page , i want to make it absolutely clear that i in no way agree with the ridiculous statements made in the citation i added from rock critic ken barnes . having contributed nothing to music himself , it is outrageous that he would have the nerve to attack what is arguably the greatest queen album . nonetheless , we need criticism as well in order to better balance the article out . i have also added many wonderful things lately , such as freddie's top listings in international polls , so don't worry too much . i also want to make it clear that , although i cite rolling stone a lot , i basically consider it to be a magazine for people who are musically illiterate . forgive me , freddie !
