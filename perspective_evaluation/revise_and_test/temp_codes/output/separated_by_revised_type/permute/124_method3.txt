: ok , mr. sarky - since you didn't check your facts ... brixton is in lambeth ! and so is kennington ! and so is stockwell , although that's irrelevant , as roger moore was actually born in vauxhall ( also in lambeth) ! incidentally , as you know , because presumably you bothered to read my original entry properly , i didn't claim john major was born in lambeth - i said he grew up there ! idiot .
