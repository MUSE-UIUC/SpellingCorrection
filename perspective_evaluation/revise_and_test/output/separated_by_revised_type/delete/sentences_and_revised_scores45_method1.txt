= = ancient warfare = = hey dirk . you gave a good answer to my question concerning the roman tactics of bringing provinces into the empire , and i read your similar question , and i may have an answer for you . there are a couple of major reasons as to twhy alexander was able to take his army so far in so short a time . alexander had the advantage of inheriting a great army from his father , and the macedonian empire saturated with , i believe , silver . another major factor was the persians they had a large army of hundreds of thousands , mostly conscripted agaist their will and treated very poorly . when darius was defeated , he actually was treated like a liberator , and could have easily not only absorbed the remnants of the persian army , but gained more volunteers . anyway , thank you for your response to my question . )
