::: i wasn't thinking about anyone in particular . i just noticed this word used several times on this page , nothing more , nothing less . on a more general note , the frikorps danmark business is of course relevant , but so is the resistance and the danish sailors in british service . the objective here must be to determine how best to describe the status of denmark during wwii , so if we mention danes serving in one side , it seems only fair to also mention those serving on the other . otherwise the overall picture will lose accuracy and this cannot be a good thing . /
