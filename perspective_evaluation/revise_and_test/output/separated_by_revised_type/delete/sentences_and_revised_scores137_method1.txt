: * what are the vast majority of indo-greek maps you are refering to ? i personally know only two published ones : one by the indian ministry of tourism on internet ( minimalist ) , and now one by the atlas der welt geschichte , which visibly takes into account all available sources , and is probably more respectable as a historical reference . any reference for this claim on the vast majority of indo-greek maps ? : * about only verified administrative regions for a map : a map is not only based on verified archaeological data as you seem to claim . literary sources also play a major role . there is almost no archaeological evidence of alexander's campaings in india , only litterary evidence , which are nevertheless the source for all the maps of alexander in india . in the case of the indo-greeks , we have a combination of archaeological and very varied literary evidence ( both greek and indian ) relating their conquests , which is visibly the base of the atlas der welt geschichte as well as my previous maps . : * dimita could very well be vima or vimaka . you failed to read the rest , which states that vima or vimaka is not considered as a proper hypothesis since the king is qualified as a yavana , an unknown occurence for kushans , and the paleography indicate a 2nd century bce date .

i disagree . he has distinctly kurdish features , and he may have been working with americans , as an interpreter or as a liaison with the peshmerga . also , it may have just been a show of support for the american invasion by a peshmerga . american flags are proudly displayed by kurds frequently . the people in sulayminiyah treated me as if i were a returning king when i visited there , even 3 years after the invasion .
