mctrain this talk of the article being a hoax is a lie . someone placed vitus ' name into a fake article about sacred skull order and then everything that was also attached to vitus got destroyed believing that it was a hoax- it all went through the grinder- but that is bullshit- there is no hoax with anything attached to the vitus person except that his name was unfairly put into that bogus society article . go to www.avoision.com and punch in what people said about him when he took on his title- those are the pople that looked to make trouble withthe guy on wikipdeia- now if anyone writes about any topic related to this guy they are labled as a hoaxer- but every peice of work i have written on is verifiable by the sources given and is truthful- why should anyone put up with this constant accusation of hoaxing- there is no hoax , except for people placing the guy's name into a bogus sacred skull order article- why should eveything else be destroyed too- this is bullshit- and i'm sick and tired of that !!!!
