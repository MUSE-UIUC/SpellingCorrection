this is the text about d . in 1911 encyclopedia : * dobrudja ( bulgarian dobritch , rumanian dobrogea ) , also written dobrudscha , and dobruja , a region of south-eastern europe , bounded on the north and west by the danube , on the east by the black sea , and on the south by bulgaria . pop . ( 1900 ) 267,808 ; area , 6ooo sq . m . the strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the romans , who defended it on the south by trajans wall , a double rampart , drawn from constantza , on the black sea , to the danube . in later times , it was utilized by russians and turks , as in the wars of 1828 , 1854 and 1878 , when it was finally wrested from turkey . by the treaty of berlin , in 1878 , the russians rewarded their rumanian allies with this land of mountains , fens and barren steppes , peopled by turks , bulgarians , tatars , jews and other aliens ; while , to add to the indignation of rumania , they annexed instead the fertile country of bessarabia , largely inhabited by rumans . after 1880 , however , the steady decrease of aliens , and , the development of the black sea ports , rendered the dobrudja a source of prosperity to rumania .
