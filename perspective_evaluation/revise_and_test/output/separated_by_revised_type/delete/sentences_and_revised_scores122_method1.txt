it isn't about referencing the material on lostpedia , more the fact that as a fan site about lost , with an article on wikipedia , it really should be linked to at the bottom . just linking to a fan wiki , which is nowhere near as accurate , detailed or well policed isn't serving users well .

:: the answer is , as usual , it depends . but with these cleanup templates a number of bots add the date parameter , so the extra work is negligable . and having the bots do it means you don't get things like devember as i typed earlier today , or more subtley december - lower case d . also if you add a named parameter to a template and it is unused , it doesn't matter , as you hint above . , 15:17 7 december 2006 ( gmt ) .

he mentioned to hybrid that he kept getting autoblocked when he used his ordinary name and hybrid and yandman seemed to understand that . insteado of giving him proper and advice , they agreed to not telling anyone until they both found a problem with the user . i see the abusive edits were made a month ago and he was finished with his ban . but if you're blocking him for sockpuppeting anyway , you might as well block your friends yandman and hybrid since they were in on it . they only told you because they had a disagreement which did not warrant a ban . lonelyboy and them were arguing about christianity . lonelyboy was already banned because hybrid and yandman and him recognize it in their disputes if you were paying attention

i took a look at his edits , and he's been back since the 4th . so far only two of his edits have been about the adult scene : the jenna jameson article , and the joey yale article . the first you knew about , the second was his classic link removal job and had already been reverted . all his other edits have been to sundry athlete articles , where he seems to be adding details about their high school years which is okay by my book ...
