aiden , you are mistaken . the paragraph does not solely exist to highlight the historical origins of christianity in judaism . it starts out with that , then continues to the parallels with judaism , concluding with the additional relationship to islam ( which is different from the relationship to judaism ) . without islam the abrahamic sentence is pointless , as the relationship to judaism has already been covered and as the term originates in islamic thought .

= = = = i'm glad to see that you've banned this user for a long time , but i can't help but feel an even longer block is in order . as you can see from their block log they've repeatedly been given long blocks ( 2 weeks , 3 weeks , 2 months , and now 3 months ) and it hasn't done anything to stop this user . i've been following this user for probably 6 months now , and i've pretty much looked at every edit they have made . i have yet to find one single good edit that they have done . every edit they do is about ethnic things , either inserting their strangely skewed demographics numbers , or en-masse inserting of ethnic categories to articles on people without providing a single source ( i have a feeling they are basing their addition of these categories solely on the last name of the person ) . in every case wikipedia is not better off by the edit this user has made . in addition , it is my belief that and are the same person . i made my case for this belief in this edit to the wikipedia : requests for investigation page . so if you agree with my belief then alm93 should also be blocked .
