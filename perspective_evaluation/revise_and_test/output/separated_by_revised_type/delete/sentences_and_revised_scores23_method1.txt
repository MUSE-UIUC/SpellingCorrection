: funny , the last time our store got bonus checks was like 1996 , and at that , it was only a couple hundred dollar bonus , for busting your butt working there the whole year , wal-mart's requirements in order to get a bonus , the lowest possible , are almost impossible to meet , sales for the store have to be up 2% for each $200 you get , thanks to their open a new store every 10 miles strategy , our store has been down at least 10% from last year , so guess what , no bonus in 2006 either , yay !!!!
