you're missing the point - or deliberately ignoring it . the link which began this thread displays an active wikipedia administrator calling a fellow administrator , and member of the wikipedia ' counter vandalism unit ' ( i.e. , your own colleague ) a ' twit ' - simply because his opinion diverges from that of the former . it is not about me in this instance - you have got that wrong . then i get all this tripe about me & personal attacks . sort yourselves , guys .

you say that , in your opinion , there's no contradiction between geaves saying that rawat was neither aware nor responsible for the hype and rawat's saying that this was the most significant and holy event in human history , etc . i say that's absurd sophistry and that , unless you offer a reasonable explanation , your position must be considered entirely without merit .
