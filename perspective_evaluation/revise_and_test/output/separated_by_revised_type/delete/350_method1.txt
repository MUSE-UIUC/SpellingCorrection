::: by no means are you being an asshole , but i do understand the implications of what you're saying ; i just don't agree since every measurement is given on first use . so i'd expect an australian to understand one of my articles on a pre-metrification australian ship just fine . your argument , and that of the mos itself , has a great deal more merit when no conversions are given so that people can't grasp the scale of things properly . since my articles can be fully understood by people on both sides of the imperial/metric scales , i view it more as a matter of taste . and , quite honestly , since i have a large number of fa , a- , and ga-class articles under my belt , most reviewers seem to agree as no one's ever challenged me on this particular point before .
