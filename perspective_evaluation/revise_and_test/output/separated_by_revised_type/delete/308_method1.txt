any notional improvement was purely accidental i can assure you . this is a pointless block . it doesn't address the reason for my incivility ( not only was i eminently polite in the opening exhanges , i will be polite in future as soon as someone stops people like hilo and the rest being deliberately obtuse for no other reason that to stall the debate and thus get their desired outcome through these despicable means ) , and it also doesn't teach ignorant pricks like alex or resolute or thryduulf or the countless other luminaries on display in there that no , not everyone's opinion is equally valid , not when it so blatantly contradicts sources or reality , and is basically just 100% grade a-bullshit straight out of the insanity farm they call a brain . never mind itn , does anyone ever check if any of these fucktards have ever gone one step further and , instead of just spouting this sort of crap at itn , has any of them ever got one of their batshit opinions about topics like football into an actual article to present it as fact ? will we find out somewhere in wikipedia what the blocker position is in association football for example ? is there an article somewhere that really says winning 13 epl titles is seen as no big deal ? does alex ferguson's article really say that his retirement had no impact and was only of local significance ? really ? seriously ? dickheads . if that story fails to get posted , it will not be my fault , it will be primarily down to the ignorant pricks who would not know the consensus process if it was drawn out for them using their own crayons , and secondarily , down to people like you and thaddeusb who just stood back and watched them piss all over what in reality should have been a very straightforward exchange of facts and evidence leading to a posting nearly 30 hours ago , back when this was actually major breaking news , rather than just ongoing news .
