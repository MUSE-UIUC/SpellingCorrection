= = licensing = = pardon me , but mp3 is already public domain . it is a file format . you cannot patent a file format as far as i know . that would be like adobe saying they have a patent on pdf or microsoft saying they have a patent on wma or doc files . you simply cannot patent or copyright or in any other way protect your idea if it involves a format of storing data . just as you cannot patent things like ntfs or fat or hfs , you cannot patent mp3 .

: by the way , now that i've read your entire blog entry , it's excellent and i totally agree with you . it's just not appropriate to link here . if it were , there would be a thousand such links in hrc's article . : a more appropriate way to do this might be to add a paragraph to the article , and link to your blog as the source , something like : :: hillary faces two major obstacles to getting elected in 2008 . the last northeasterner and the last senator elected president was john f kennedy in 1960 . prior to that , the last senator elected president was benjamin harrison in 1888 . : someone may still object to it , but it's much more subtle this way , and wikipedia loves text with sources much more than external links . : also , remember to sign your responses on this page using four tildes , as shown above .

::: the original argument between us began when you accused me of bad faith and did not apologise . all i had done was try to improve a project structure but i made a mistake in terms of wp deletion guidelines , because i was unfamiliar with required procedure . an administrator , sam vimes , helped to correct the mistake and put an explanation on the discussion page . this was immediately followed by an apology from me for the oversight . the next entry in the discussion was you weighing in with bad faith , breach of etiquette and suchlike insulting rubbish . if you don't like vicious abuse then don't insult people . you latest accusation of fait accompli is also an insult : you are effectively saying that we hatched a conspiracy instead of reaching consensus . once again , you are completely out of order . |
