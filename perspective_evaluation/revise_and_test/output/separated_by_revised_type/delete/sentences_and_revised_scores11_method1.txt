this doesn't really make sense . the first time i heard the term was when i heard of the living end . by no means are they a hardcore band ( even though many of the songs on their first album were pretty fast ) . i think , though that punkabilly is a better and easier term to remember the crossover between punk and rockabilly , as it fuses the actual terms . the word psychobilly sounds like it would have some psychadelic elements also in the sound . -
