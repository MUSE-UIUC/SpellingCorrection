:::::::::::: it is incredible that a person unable to write one correct sentence about teaches me about subtility , i am talking about really happened and not about what someone has declared or not declared . read the external link . and as for the subitility : the slovaks had 0 to 4 duputies in the 420 members parliament ( not 4% but 4 persons ) , and in practise they were prevented from voting on ethnic grounds . that is the only thing that matters . not only the voting system was bad , there were no free elections even at that bad level . the non-free elections had both political and magyarisation reasons and they must and will be mentioned here .
