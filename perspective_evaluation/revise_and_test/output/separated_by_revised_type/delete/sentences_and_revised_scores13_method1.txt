is it certain that he was a nazi party member ? i know that the bbc article calls him a nazi , but i took that as a generic usage . my understanding is that regular german military ( as opposed to the ss ) weren't supposed to be party members . there were exceptions , but this guy doesn't seem like he would be one .

: well quite , i mean the whole concept of the 3rd intermediate period is a load of old rubbish isn't it ? an overgeneralisation of a complex period , the characterisation actually inhibits understanding of the span it's meant to illuminate . e.g. was it really a period of division and weakness ? is the 21st dynasty really significantly different to the end of the 20th ? why not end the period with dynasty 26 , since that represents the greatest break : namely egypt's long running occupation by an external empire ? as for ' the themes of egyptian history ' , well that's just it isn't it ? the victorians were just aching for a decline and fall narrative and here's the period for the icing on the cake . but far better , surely , to address these questions in the historiography section of the article . i haven't the sources , personally .

:::: can we agree to keep the tag based on the principle that it is better present when not needed ( false-positive ) than not when needed ( false-negative ) ? i am not too concerned with the current notable ... phrase but second leifern's tagging , for example because of a concern i brought up about a week ago that the ocntrovertial nature of homeopathy should not be alluded to twice in the introduction becase it diverts the issue from exegesis to premature evaluation ; i suggested a comprehensive sentence that highlighted rather than obscured the controvertiallity issue but without this diversion . there are many little things in the article that were written from a lay perspective of those who have read a bit about homeopathy and think that they know a lot , and unless those are repaired there is no reason to remove the tag . besides , it is reasonable to have this tag on indefinitely due to the wide disagreement on the topic . this is not a bad thing as one thing can be stated with certainty : that the issue of homeopathy is not as simple as it looks , so each reader will need both critical faculties and research time to make sense of it . 1 july 2005 14:28 ( utc )

congratulations on appearing as schizophrenic as the likely owner of this ip address . i guarantee it will not be owned by the same person twice over a period of more than 3 or 4 days . internode has well over 10000 subscribers to its broadband internet service and this dynamically allocated ip is just one of very many ;)

as a former member of the inc , i can understand the desire of critics to remain anonymous on the internet , especially in light of the ross tipon lawsuit . i would like to point out that the gentleman raising this claim is anonymous himself , as he has not signed his post and if it is who i assume it is , then he is using a pseudonym which negates his claim . if the one who posted this claim wants to be taken seriously , then he should start by revealing his true identity and motivation . 4 july 2005 17:52 ( utc )
