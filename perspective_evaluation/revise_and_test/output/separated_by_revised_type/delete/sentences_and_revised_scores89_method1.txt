: if you base an argument on a lie , you can take the argument anywhere you like . the patriot act is not an anti-terrorism law . there are parts of it that are used to battle terrorism , but that is just a part of the entire act . you may as well say , the patriot act was passed to control illegal shipments of bananas into to the u.s. and now it is being used to track terrorist funds passing in and out of the united states ! big brother is out to get you !!! as i've said many times , there are many ( many ) reasons to dislike the patriot act - you don't need to make up new ones .
