hi susan , and welcome to wikipedia ! i'm afraid i reverted your change to talk : nairobi . you erased all of the existing discussion there ; we want to keep that . the other thing is that your description of nairobi isn't really suitable as an encyclopedia article it was more of a personal account . that's ok , of course , but wikipedia isn't the place to put it .

: i put up a picture of t3 because the old warrior article had a picture of an undead warrior in t1 already , and since i didn't want to delete it , i switched the ud-warrior to a secondary picture and put a picture of a human warrior ( wearing t3 ) up as the main picture . why t3 instead of t2 ? becuase wrath looks hideous . i'd be fine with replacing the t3 pic with a t1 pic ( though t3 is more imposing ) , but i think keeping it as a human warrior is a good ideait's the most commonly played race for that class . ( well , according to the wow census sites ; which , admittedly , aren't 100% accurate . )

just viewed the mess on the fnc page that gamaliel has caused . it's common sense to view a talk page and anyway what you were trying to add was highly pov . why did you keep editing with your own pov when different users were reverting it ? if wiki has admins like this , it still has a long way to go before it can gain any real credibility .
