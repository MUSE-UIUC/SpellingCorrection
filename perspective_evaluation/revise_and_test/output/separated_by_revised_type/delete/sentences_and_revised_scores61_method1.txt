it is you , who is arguing in a neo-ricardian framework . the difference between you and other neo-ricardians is that you claim that there is only one basic commodity , namely labor , thinking thereby to save the ltv , whereas other neoricardians would claim , that besides labor there are other basic commodities , thereby questioning the importance of the ltv and the consequences marx drew from it . a corn theorist , for instance , is a neo-ricardian , who claims that besides labor also corn is a basic commodity . against this reo-ricardian reasoning some marxists argue ( who are then of course no reo-ricardians ) , that it is the common social substance ( see quote of marx in the article ! ) and not the physical or technical substance that matters , for the rest see end of article .
