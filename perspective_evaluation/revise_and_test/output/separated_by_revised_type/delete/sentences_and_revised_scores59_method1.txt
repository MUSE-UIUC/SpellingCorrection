jesus christ . can i just go and add the sentences : ( 1 ) cannistraro ran the agency's task force on the contras while at the cia . [ the first article ] ( 2 ) when the contra program was transferred by reagan to the nsc , cannistraro was made director of intelligence . ( 3 ) while at the nsc , cannistraro coordinated inter-agency meetings on aid for the contras . [ the second article ] . these are all almost word for word what the articles you just read say . the point ( 2 ) is from : kornbluh , p ., and m . byrne . 1993 . the iran-contra scandal : the declassified history . new york : the new press . ( p . xviii ): president reagan “ transferred the contra program from the cia to the nsc after congressional authorization for the cia’s contra program expired in mid 1984 . ” and we already know that cannistraro was made director of intel at nsc from before , but just to make sure , it's from : “ director of nsc intelligence from 1984 to 1987 , [ vincent ] cannistraro went on to serve as chief of operations for the cia's counterterrorism center ... ” from the pbs interview : http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/interviews/ ok ?

: the feather will land first !! ( and please don't include this in the article ) . let's do a calculation . the mass of the earth is about 1024 times bigger than the mass of the hammer . therefore , the acceleration of the earth is 1024 times smaller than the acceleration of the hammer , so if the hammer falls through 1 m , the earth will move 10-24 m during the same time . such short distances , which correspond to an energy of 100000 tev , are not probed even by the most energetic particle accelerators ! let's now do another calculation . suppose we're dropping the feather . the hammer , which is presumably on the ground , attracts the feather with its gravity . the additional acceleration of the feather is given by gm/r2 , where m is the mass of the hammer and r is the distance from the feather to the hammer . this gives roughly 10-10 m/s2 , which is much bigger than the effect suggested by the anonymous .
