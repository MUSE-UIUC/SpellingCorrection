famous or not ? who picks ? 71.85.241.27 has been making a lot of deletions that were added by a variety of other people . this user says he or she was born in st. louis , but that isn't a decent qualification to make these determinations . put a person up for discussion if you don't think they are famous . do a little research and determine just how widespread knowledge of them is . famous doesn't mean they'll be recognized on the street anywhere in the world , but that a society or culture has recognized them for some reason . 71.85.241.27 allowed scientists to remain on the list while deleting people who are in the pop culture scene . give some reasons other than a single person's opinion before deleting a person . 71.85.241.27 the ip address also resolves to an australian provider . maybe this user is just on a short vacation from st. louis or maybe he or she has been gone for a decade and doesn't really know who is famous and who is not .

she barely has a 5 octave range . it's not impossible to have an 8 octave range which is currently the guiness world record for largest vocal range held by georgia brown . g2-g10 is her range but i've only heard g2 since her g10 is actually able to be heard and sounds more like a b8 or b9 . nicola sedda actually has the largest vocal range that i know of which i only remember his highest as a9 . the fact is that mariah has only displayed a range of bb2-g #7 which is very close to a full 5 octaves . bb2 has only been displayed in an interview and g #7 has been hit twice in live performances of emotions and seemed fairly easily done . besides bb2 she has hit c3 numerous times . emotions , my all , you and i(live performance ) , and other songs have c3 as their lovest . besides g #7 , f #7 is her highest in the studio version of all in your mind .
