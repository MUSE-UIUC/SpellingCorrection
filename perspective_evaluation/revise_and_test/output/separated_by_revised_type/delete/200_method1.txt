what advertisment did i put ? i can't believe what you say and do . you're just horrible ! your quote doesn't say that my article doesn't qualify either .... if a topic has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject , it is presumed to satisfy the inclusion criteria for a stand-alone article . that's just saying what is allowed , not what is not . though , i'm done checking back here because you're obviously not playing with a full deck .
