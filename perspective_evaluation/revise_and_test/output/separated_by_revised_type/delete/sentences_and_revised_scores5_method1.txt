= = infobox = = i made a infobox for danish universities (: template : infobox danish university ) . it is simply copied from the swedish one , but adapted to the info i could find on the copenhagen university website . i couldn't find any numbers on how to break up the student body into undergraduate and doctoral students , nor on how large a part of the staff is actually teaching staff . look at the swedish box at uppsala university for comparison . if these things can be found , the template can be adjusted accordingly . athletics is important at american universities and doesn't really need to be in the infobox for european universities any more than a lot of other student activities or societies . /

thank you so much for the change on the life in the united states box in the economy of the united states article . i have to in truth admit the the box is merely an adaptation of another-i don't really know how to make one from scratch so i also had no idea how to fit it on the page . but i don't see why you think it's ugly , it's the same color as all the others , the economy article just happens to have the longest table i've ever seen on it already -)
