hi maury , great recent work on the bac 1-11 . i added the court-line pic ( also used on the court line page ) , and i happen to know the colours are correct . the image is a little washed out , but not to the extent that it is meant to be portraying a the yellow/gold/orange scheme - it is actually pink ! i made a note about this on the 1-11 talk page but maybe you didn't see it . though the yellow scheme was probably the best known , as it was used on their first tristar g-baaa , they had three other funky schemes which were used across the rest of the fleet - green bands , pink bands ( also used on the second l-1011 ) , and purple bands . they used to be a cheerful sight flying over our school in hemel hempstead when i was a kid - always turned my head to watch whenever they went over , though the 1-11s in particular were hard to avoid as they were so noisy ! airliners nowadays are a lot better , but also a lot more boring , and that goes for the colour schemes of the airlines too .

danny , i would be very happy to have their view expressed as well . here you/we are saying that josephus is biased . on the jesus page , he is noted as a being reliable . perhaps it depends strongly on what is being said about whom , though i do not know this is necessarily the case . it does not dismiss them , they are still real and present . the question as to descent could be answered rather well via dna testing of their priests and levites as well as mitochrondrial dna testing . but there is risk , the desired results might not be obtained . would this meet the need : : the samaritans have insisted that they are direct descendants of the northern israelite tribes of ephraim and manasseh , who survived the destruction of the northern kingdom of israel by the assyrians in 722 b.c.e. the inscription of sargon ii records the deportation of a relatively small proportion of the israelites ( 27 , 290 , according to the annals ) , so it is quite possible that a sizable population remained that could identify themselves as israelites , the term that the samaritans prefer for themselves . : samaritan historiography would place the basic schism from the remaining part of israel after the twelve tribes conquered the land of canaan , lead by joshua . after joshua's death , eli the priest left the tabernacle which moses erected in the desert and established on mount gerizim , and built another one under his own rule in the hills of shilo ( 1 sam 1:1 -3 ; 2:12 -17 ) . thus , he established both an illegitimate priesthood and an illegitimate place of worship . according to this description , the jews are the dissidents !

ed poor , * east sea is a local name both in south korea and vietnam . it is not an internationally accepted geographic name . * geographic explanation for the sea of japan is obviously needless for this page , but your explanation is inaccurate . the sea is bounded by the japanese archipelago , sakhalin and the asian continent , not only the korean peninsula .

szczecin isn't consensual so far as native english speakers are concerned - it's inconsistent with the wikipedia naming convention to use the normal english form . for this place , that accepted english name is stettin . it's a shame that at least some native polish speakers dislike the english word . that doesn't change what the normal english usage is .
