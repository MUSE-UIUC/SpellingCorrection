yes , i meant that a 3+ size should accommodate most people . ::: the latest change doesn't seem to make any difference in ff : at 4+ , the letters overlap and are illegible . however , this may be due to limitations of wikipedia , for the text is constrained into a fixed column that doesn't allow space for 4+ . 3+ looks good , though , as it did before . 18:08 , 2005 july 18 ( utc )
