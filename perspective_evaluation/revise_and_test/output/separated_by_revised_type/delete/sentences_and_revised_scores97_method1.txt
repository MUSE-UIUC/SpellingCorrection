:::::: it might help if you can provide proof that including robert spencer ( a new york times top-20 book author and participant in several high-profile think tanks ) will drag it into the gutter . his critics issue ad-hominem attacks , but fail to proof that his statements are fundamentally false , which essentially classifies them rather than their victim as members of aforementioned category . i added the epithet controversial though in order to address your concerns .

: actually , the basis for this argument comes from the fact that by using the word pegasus , you have established a referant . the word itself is it . i.e. , using the name automatically implies the existence of a concept behind it ; additionally , there is no way for a person to declare a concept not to exist , for in order to declare its nonexistence , it must exist . thus , any referent thus used must , circularly , exist .

for the record , i was serious about running in the rfa . i was not trolling or disrupting , i was advised that i should run in the rfa to see how it was like , and i did so . there should have been more questions during the rfa if there was any questions about sincerity . the rfa was not a joke , it was serious . i feel i should have been made an admin and then would have been the better example . i felt that there was a possibility for confirmation and this should serve as example for other users to be afraid of self nominations to the rfa , even when there is clearly a poll support for running in the rfa . as i am truely afraid , shocked and dismayed at the admins response . as it seems now there is a new rule , if the admin feel you are faking your rfa , they can block you with zero assumptions of good faith .
