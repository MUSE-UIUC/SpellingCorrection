: i agree with bob ( again ! ) this canned response ( from {{ sofixit }}) is useless . there is a lot of data on this page ( hundreds of table rows ): fixing it by hand would take me a long time , which i don't have . checking the data by hand is going to be tedious . was this page generated programmatically ? if so , can whomever has the program check the data and regenerate the page with imperial units ? if not , perhaps someone can write a program to regenerate the page : i don't have time .

: actually , the universe only has one set of laws . it's just that under different conditions , different portions of the laws become the dominant force . scientists tend to simplify things by only using and studying those portions of the laws that are dominant for any given set of conditions . this leads to the appearance that quantum physics , newtonian physics , and general relativity are three different sets of laws .
