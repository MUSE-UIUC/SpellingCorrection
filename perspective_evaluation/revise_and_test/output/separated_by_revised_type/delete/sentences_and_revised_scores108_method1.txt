= = you are the one who is trolling = = i was not trolling . i went to see the user page of this person who kept vandalising my writings in dog to see what his writings were . his user name is egordon . it turns out , his writings are generally incorrect and far more in need of citations than mine . so i asked him for citations where they were needed , and here merely weasled out of it by deleting the { fact } text , without showing the citations . he says half the land in australia is crown land and it is mainly used as airports and utilities . what nonsense , half the land in australia is used for airports ? how can you allow such spench to remain in wikipedia ? now look what you do . he was not only asking me for citations in dog where they are not needed , he was erasing whole 3-paragraph text that i had spent hours creating . then you came back and erased them again , which i believe is also vandalism , and quite insulting . nobody told me why i needed citations , neither you nor egordon are even qualified to ask me for citations since you are not veterinarians . you and he are guilty of vandalising another writers perfectly sound writings , and you should both be banned of your editorial priv's . i am going to go over your heads and have both of you removed now . how dare you block me ? how dare you ? this is utterly absurd . if anybody is guilty of trolling it is you , why are you here on my page ? at least egordon stopped stalking me , but you haven't . what do you do , wake up in the morning , turn on your computer , and go right to my user page to check up on me . you are not qualified to edit my writings .
