i don't see where any of the book references have anything to do with yugos . i guess the books may have yugo references in them , but if they do , that should be so stated , exactly , or else the refernces to books is pov and unverified . and who is this conscensous on the porsche thing ? who forms the conscensous . if i and other people with no real knowledge about programming start an article , and wipe out any corrections , as your editors have do here , do they get to form the conscensous ? and if you , who are an expert on the subject edit it , and they roll it back , is that okay with you ? you can not have website claiming to be fact . yet that is compiled by people with a npov , with an axe to gring , or who repeat rumors , affecting peoples lives and livlehoods . this is what wiki editors did to john seigenthaler . i am sure you a familiar with that . i used to live in san antonio , and being an anglo , i have a point of view on racism in sa . should i pubish an article , or edit an article on sa ? i could prove that it is a problem . but i wouldn't do that , because i am not a expert on race relations , or have a degree in sociology , so i don't have a right to pubish that as fact as wiki publishes articles about people and things . you can not just let a bunch of people publish what ever they think in a public forum where some people are going to take it as truth because you call your self an encylopedia . and wiki articles are blindly republished as truth in othe online content . so it is not my legal threats that matter . it will be resolved on a much higher level that mine . this whole thing is why bill gates doesn't make windows open source . wouldn't that make your job so much fun , when anyone can change the operating system at any second ?

as far as dubious sources , this page has most of its sources coming from various che biographies written by friends and appologists for them ... this gives a pov . if you leave out my section , then almost everything else from the page should be deleted as well . furthermore , if my sources are dubious at best what kind of dubious pov is giong to be provided when quoting the thoughts and words of che directly ? do you really think che would criticize himself ? if supporting che and being che are the only qualifications for being a proper source for this article ( and that seems to be what is being said here ) then we have violated the wiki npov rules ... quite blatantly .
