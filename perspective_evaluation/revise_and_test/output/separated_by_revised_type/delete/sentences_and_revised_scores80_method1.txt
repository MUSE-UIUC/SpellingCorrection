= = lots of little npov , verifiability edits needed = = i started to work on this article but have been called to a meeting . the overall tone is not especially pov , but their are lots of opinions and weasel words and weasel phrases . it has been criticized ok , by whom ? i've seen much worse , but someone needs to go through and tighten this stuff line by line . another example is speculation i tagged about the next teams to be included may be true , may be interesting , but it needs a verifiable reference ( a comment on the talk page would suffice ) . i think it should not take a lot of time to make these many little changes if the editor is knowledgeable on this game .

= = msa garratts = = hi , the idea about an article is a good one , but unfortunately you've started out with an error . that is understandable as the subject is complex . the wagr first imported the m class garratts , in 1911 . these are very important locos , because they are the third class of garratt to be built , and the first main line garratt , showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler . they were followed up in 1912 by the ms class , only difference being the ms class were superheated . so they were also the first class of garratts to be the subject of a repeat order . both classes were built by beyer-peacock . the msa class were constructed in 1930 by the wagr in their own workshops . apparently a copy of the ms class , they did seem to have some cosmetic differences . the story does not end there , but moves to victoria . the vr g class apparently is copied from the ms class , the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge . outside framed garratts are very rare , even in the smaller gauges . but wait there is more ( no , not steak knives ! ) . the design was used again , for the australian portland cement's 3'6 line near geelong , the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939 . the boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored g42 . so in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years , used on three railway , on two gauges and built by two manufacturers , with , if i've added it up correctly , 27 locos constructed . personally i think the article should cover the history of the design , and include all the varients . some work would be required to hunt down variations , though . so yes , i think it does deserve an article . please feel free to use the above if you wish . cheers , michael .
