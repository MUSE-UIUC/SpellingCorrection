: this isn't really true ; the operation of charge conjugation is simply as stated in the article . charge conjugation is not a symmetry of the universe exactly because neutrinos and antineutrinos are only observed with one handedness and not the other , but this does not prevent a formal use of a charge-conjugation operation .

the current wording in this article suggests that this fuel cell can convert carbon into hydrogen . this is , of course , ridiculous as no chemical process can transmute one element into another .

: roy , good questions . yes it's actual thrust data from the columbia mission , sts-107 . however you can't directly measure thrust . rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure . also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust . in actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing , even if engine thrust was constant ( which it's not for the srbs ) . i include below some more info i was preparing to post : : because of the frequent confusion on this point , i uploaded a thrust/time graph for the srbs . i also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this . srb sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each . each ssme produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level . thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is : ( 393,000 * 3 ) + ( 2,800,000 * 2 ) = 6.779 million pounds force , or 3.075 million kgf , or 30.16 mn . using these numbers the srbs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust . : this is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number , some even erroneously adding sea level or liftoff thrust . there are six possible thrust numbers for the srb : : * sea level liftoff thrust : * sea level peak thrust : * sea level average thrust : * vacuum liftoff thrust : * vacuum peak thrust : * vacuum average thrust : the problem is most references don't state which they are using . this is why references state srb thrust from 2.65 million lbs ( probably sea level average thrust ) to 3.4 million lbs ( probably vacuum peak thrust ) . : when comparing srb thrust to , say , saturn v f-1 engine thrust , you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type . the f-1 is not throttlable , so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust . at sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total . by comparision the srb thrust changes over the burn time ( see chart ) . space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force , or about 88.6% of the saturn v . : in theory you could compare the srb thrust at t+20 sec which is somewhat higher , but that wouldn't be liftoff thrust .
