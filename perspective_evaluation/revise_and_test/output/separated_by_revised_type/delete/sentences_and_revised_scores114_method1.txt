to jmabel : ad hominem : i had no idea who wrote the original text and i dont care who dahn is . i was describing a superficial course of events : someone consistently removes reference to moldova without apparent reason while keeping reference to romania . ( especially funny was logic : no , pieces of moldavia are not in moldova , but in bessarabia , which easily reads : there is no moldova , there is part of romania stolen by russia , no ? ) . you yourself wrote : enormous vocabulary difficulty here . my point exactly . conflation of two different although related topics in a single article only contributes to this difficulty . putting two sloppy text into one page does not help understanding . the topics are perfectly separable along the timeline .
