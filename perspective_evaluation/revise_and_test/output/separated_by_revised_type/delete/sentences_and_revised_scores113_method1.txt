you wrote about ( elsewhere ) about your dream of creating election pages after the election you're anticipating part of my proposed wikiproject ( house - 2008 ) . i'm was thinking that the parts would be something like this : * 0 - create a draft of the project ; recruit some editors to do phase 1 . * 1 - move really fast to create campaign articles ( template/shell/skeleton/whatever ) for all competitive races where an incumbent won or there was an open race . copy the info from articles on challengers into the campaign articles . then slap redirects on the articles on challengers ( if of questionable notability ) so that there is no need for afds for these . ( such afds are bad precedent , in general a waste of time regardless of outcome , and successful afds could kill off source info . ) * 2a - refine the phases of the project and what needs to be done - for example , what a really good campaign article might contain ( polls , snapshots of campaign funding at various points , results , newspaper endorsements , a good selection of links to local newspaper stories , etc . ) * 2b - create campaign articles for all competitive races where a challenger defeated the incumbent . * 2c - finish the 50-100 campaign articles for 2006 house races . that might include a rating/evaluation of the quality of each article . * 2d - ( optional ) - do the same for the 30+ senate races . ( i just looked at the florida senate campaign article the other day - except for the polling info , it's devoid of any significant content except primary results . ) * 3 - improve the quality of wikipedia bio articles for incumbents in competitive races ( defeated or not ) , winning challengers , and notable but not-winning challengers : good citations , good copyediting , etc ., as baseline for 2008 . * 4a - ( starting mid-2007 ? ) build a 2008 comprehensive master page , and set up campaign articles for every race expected to be competitive/notable ( that is , every race listed on the master page ) . evaluate feasibility of doing transclusions from individual campaign articles rather than updating the master page directly . ( there are both human and technical issues here , i believe ) . * 4b - recruit editors to take responsibility for maintaining each ( individual ) campaign article . ideally we can find 3 or 4 editors who are ( a ) local and ( b ) can work together well , for each campaign ( race ) expected to be notable in 2008 . your thoughts ? |

: i did not know that erbacan was also in the turkish government in 1974 ... in any case , every turkish politician is within the kemalistic ideology ... since noone criticising or rejecting or judging this ideology , but they all accept it . taksim can as well have this link . the megali idea was not that simple as establishing a greek state that covers all the greeks , as u said ... the greeks of pontus , southern italy , former southern serbia ( modern fyrom ) , eastern rumelia , alexandria , cyprus , where excluded . yes , megali idea shares similarities with enosis , that's why the link is present in that article . but adding megali idea and excluding kemalistic ideology from taksim , seems , at least weird , cause kemalism is much more relevant with taksim than megali idea could ever be . regards
