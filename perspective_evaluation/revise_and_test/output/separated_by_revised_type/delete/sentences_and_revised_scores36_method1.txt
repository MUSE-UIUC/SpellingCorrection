::: i intended the comment about multiplicity to be an exception to the first line about quadratic convergence . you are correct that this is less than clear . your suggested phrasing is fine . durand-kerner is newton's method simultaneously on a vector of root guesses , with the derivative of the polynomial approximated by the derivative of what the polynomial would be if its roots were the current set of guesses . this permits a lot of redundant computation to be eliminated , and the algorithm parallelized . if f(x ) is a 4th degree polynomial and p , q , r , s are root approximations , the approximated polynomial is ( x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(x-s ) and its derivative at p is ( p-q)(p-r)(p-s ) so a durand-kerner iteration for p would be p = p - f(x)/((p-q)(p-r)(p-s )) and iterations of identical form for q , r , and s follow immediately . you are correct this looks a lot like the example given in the jacoby's method article .

: stanzegel writes to ctswyneken : an anonymous editor is like a sniper in a tree top , taking pot shots at those trying to do serious work on the ground , and dropping his waste matter into the work in progress . i'm not sure that anything such a person attempts to add is worth verifying but should be summarily deleted on the basis that a responsible person would identify himself . if the material is truly worthy , a responsible scholar will get around to adding it . in the present case , i believe we are dealing with a sock puppet for an editor who has been banned previously for similar activity and may be on probation right now . if so , that probation is being violated , and keeping his edits or wasting time on his contributions simply enables continuing violations . -
