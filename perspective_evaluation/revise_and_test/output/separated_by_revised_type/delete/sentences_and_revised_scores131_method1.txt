= = list of prophets in intro = = hey all . the list of prophets was fleshed out to the closer to full list of known , accepted prophets . i knwo this list has been kept short by agreement way back , so i'm putting this topic here to allow people to discuss which prophets should be listed , if any , and how many . i believe there's a more comprehensive list elsewhere in the baha'i articles which mention hud , the prophet to the sabeans , noah , etc . all prophets that would have to go into a full list of prophets accepted by baha'is . i think it's all two long . my own view is that jesus , moses , and muhammad make sense , because these are central prophets to religions that are typically seen as abrahamic religions . buddha is added ( i suspect ) to clarify that the religion is not outside of connection to dharmic traditions either . obviously a full treatment of prophets , the nature thereof , and the relationships between them would be inappropriate in the lead paragraph . anybody have a bright idea for better summarization of the point without toasting off the lead paragraph as unreadable ?
