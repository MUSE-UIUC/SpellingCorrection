. you don't need to know english language to live in the french-speaking quebec province or chinese language to live in tibet . in contrast it's very difficult to live in japan without knowing japanese language . korean language hardly constitutes an alternative to japanese like french is in quebec (/canada )

:::: from a cbs segment : “ there's a lot of strategy , a lot of gambits being played . for example : three rocks in a row , that's the avalanche ; three papers , that's the bureaucrat ; a rock followed by two papers , a fistful of dollars ; and that's really only scratching the surface . ” if it's real enough for a major broadcasting company , i think you should seriously reconsider your stance and become more open-minded .
