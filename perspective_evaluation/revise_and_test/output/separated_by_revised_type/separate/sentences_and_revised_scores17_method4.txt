my understanding is not odd and certainly not incorrect ( thats the last thing it is ) . titles in britain when being examined in such fine detail have many ambiguities and many historical exceptions exist , and you will often find people making up the rules as they go along ( e.g , a divorced princess of wales's title , the title of princess consort etc ) which is why there is the possibility that either side of an argument may be right . you do have a good point but i think you're relying too much on an isolated case , which , in any case , doesn't explicitly show what you're trying to prove .
