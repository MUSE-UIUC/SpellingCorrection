: a certain admin will block you if you tell the truth about a certain user's dirty tricks . but she won't do anything to the user who pulled the dirty tricks . she only punishes the victim of the dirty tricks . the perpetrator goes scot free . that's wikipedia justice , as practiced by admin pschemp . : apparently she wants no one to know that ryulong deleted my request for help on khoikhoi's talk page , falsely describing my request for help as vandalism in his edit summary . oops ! was it uncivil again , for me to tell the truth ? if so , then prosecutors in court will never be able to tell the truth about crimes , because it would be an uncivil personal attack to use words such as lie , dishonest , vandal , thief , murderer , rapist , etc . the judge would get too upset by such uncivil comments . come to think of it , every time an admin describes a user's action as vandalism , or a user as a vandal , that's an improper personal attack , according to pschemp's logic . if pschemp treats people equally ( not likely ) , then she better block all the admins who make those personal attacks of describing a particular user's behavior as vandalism . and she better block ryulong for using that personal attack against me in his false edit summaries .
