i would agree that a kind of synopsis ( i.e what does this sonnet actually mean ? ) on each sonnet that would help out the average school age student would be useful . i wouldn't want to stray to far into an individual interpretation though . i think there should be quite a bit of citing sources for these kinds of articles which are more subjective than objective . anyway it's a really big project which i feel will take some time . thanks for your contributions
