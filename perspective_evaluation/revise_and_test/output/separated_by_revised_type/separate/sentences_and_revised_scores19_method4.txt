the result of the vfd discussion was keep ( the default when there is no consensus ) . the vote didn't tell us whether it should or shouldn't be renamed/moved , merged or redirected . if someone can get consensus for this , or just fancies being bold and seeing it they can make something that everybody will be happy with , go ahead . if you believe that there's genuinely no information to be merged , just redirectthis doesn't stop someone who thinks there is material to be merged just merging it into the target article . a redirect doesn't destroy information ; it's all in the history .

strong encrypted f2f networks will mainly use strong symmetric encryption ( in particular , the only theoretically secure one-time pad ) for every link . who ever wrote this article could do with a brush up on practical cryptography ( no .. not the book ) . otp is pretty unpractical here .
