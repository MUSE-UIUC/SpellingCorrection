::: we seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot . i hope we can fix that ; there was no ill intent on my part . as i said , i'm glad to wait until you're finished . however , to answer your question , for topics as pov-prone as religion , i prefer to also see references from modern scholars outside the religion . and now that i think about it , part of what made me think it was an essay was that the text seemed povish to me . however , it seems like you're not particularly interested in outside feedback on your article at this stage , so i'll move along . feel free to press on ahead ; perhaps i'll check it out again in a month or so .

: agreed , but it's the date that needs changing - using the 1979 jubilee line logic , the h&c ; & ell should both be in the 1980s , which is when they became known by those names . finchley rd to willesden green opened in 1879 , so i'm changing the date to that , & clarifying the definition to the date the first section opened ( not necessarily under the current line name ) , which is the definition that seems to have been used for other lines ' dates .

= = proterozoic template = = hello - looks like you created the proterozoic template , very nice , but i was wondering if it would be possible to invert it so that the oldest part of the section is at the bottom ? that is standard practice in geology and is more common in these charts , since it allows the visualization of the lower and upper parts of the column . i would do it but i don't think i'm smart enough with the syntax in these templates . if you have time , thanks in advance . cheers

: rest assured , there is nothing incorrect about the posted equations , i've been using them in this form for more than a decade . the volume units used in the equations is cubic meters . since there are 1000 liters in a cubic meter , you need to multiply by 1000 to convert from cubic meters to liters . now if you wanted to use published specs ( usually quoted in liters ) in the equations provided , you would divide the vas(liters ) by 1000 to get vas in cubic meters . units can be challenging even for engineers , it may help to work through a few examples using published specs to get a handle on things . drivers from peerless , vifa , scan speak and seas tend to have very complete parameter sets that make sense using these equations . some manufacturers , especially car audio companies , publish specs that are incomplete or inconsistent and will give problems when working through the equations .

mild notoriety only within wikipedia ? within wikipedia , it has been the single most discussed web site for the past 6 months straight , far surpassing the likes of wikitruth , which has its own article . outside of wikipedia , it has an alexa ranking currently of 35 , 000 , which also far exceeds wikitruth's of 100,000 or so . it has been in an increasing number of news reports as well , up around 20 from reputable sources now , and the frequency of these is increasing as well . it is known for things outside of wikipedia too : 1 ) as an example of censorship - wikipedia has gone to pains to censor it . this is relevant to people who have no idea what wikipedia is , because this is a critic site that is not allowed to exist . 2 ) cyber stalking , hate speech , and many other issues which wikipedia review has hit on , and it has been viewed by some pro-wikipedia loyalists that wikipedia review is an example of these , and that it should be discussed in a context that does not include discussion of wikipedia , or of its criticisms of wikipedia . it is the first and largest place for criticism of wikipedia . in such circumstances , notability is clearly established . it is not just a forum , it has its own domain name too and exists as a legal entity . the original article was created as spam just days after the forum was created . at that time , it should have been deleted . we are looking at a vastly different picture now .
