: your list is your problem . but if you want to remove the wrestlers other people have put on the list , thats something else . like it or not , the wwe hardcore title is the most well-known hardcore title and you can't sweep its history under the rug to be replaced by a long list of guys and promotions nobody has ever heard of or went out of business ten years ago . like i said , this isn't any one person's list of favorite wrestlers . it isn't even a list of famous wrestlers since someone removed that tag .

to my memory the ' no ' refers to the negative as per linguistic negatives . it doesnt mean the word no . i dont do linguistics ( the science of linguistics i.e. which is where that ' no ' comes from)but know the wiradjui lannguage and culture pretty well . a lot copy that ' wiradjui = no ' material not realisng it is not about word definition but linguistic structure . i just do wiradjuri word definition tied to where the word refers to . linguistics/archaeology claims there is just one true ' word ' a ssuch which is ' sign ' . there are multiple words if australia's indigneous language is considered . because this language has been mostly separated from what it refers to ( cultere ) the archs/linguists then think they can take possession . its like the rock art battles where some archs claim they must be preserved because current day indigneosu people are painting over them , ( a cultural practice as part of ongoing culture ) . so linguistics may tell us that wiradjuri = no . it doesnt . the word means what it does similar to ' sign's ' referent = sign .
