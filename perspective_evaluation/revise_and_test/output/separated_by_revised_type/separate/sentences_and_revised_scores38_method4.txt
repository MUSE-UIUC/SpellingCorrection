i believe i've now tagged all the locally uploaded images on the english wikipedia with the the proper label — someone with admin powers will need to do the actual deletion . ( if it takes too long , i suppose i can just upload the corrected versions here as well ) . i'm not sure what to do on the vietnamese wikipedia , though — i don't know any of the procedures .

about a year ago , there was talk of launching a second new horizons spacecraft to uranus and some other binary kbo . this was before 2003 ub313 was discovered . it so happens to be that a second new horizons spacecraft could be launched on a uranus-2003 ub313 mission if launched between 2007-2009 . i wonder if mission planners have yet pondered this idea ....

one of the interesting things about dell is that more and more people are using resellers to purchase dell equipment because ( a ) dell's volume discounting is available to resellers but not to end users ( so therefore resellers are often able to buy from dell and resell at a price lower than dell's list price and still make an acceptable margin ) and ( b ) dell's customer service center is apparently run by braindamaged rodents .
