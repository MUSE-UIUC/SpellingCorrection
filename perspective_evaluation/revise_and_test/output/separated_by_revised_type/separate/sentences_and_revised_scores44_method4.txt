re : six-day war * please do not keep undoing other people's edits without discussing them first . this is considered impolite and unproductive . if you continue , you may be blocked from editing wikipedia under the three-revert rule , which states that nobody may revert an article to a previous version more than three times in 24 hours . ( note : this also means editing the page to reinsert an old edit . if the effect of your actions is to revert back , it qualifies as a revert . ) thank you .

= = above all = = friedolin , could it be that you are mistranslating the english translation of über alles yourself ? above all does mean above all things . the popular mistranslation you are attacking would be germany , germany everywhere ( from überall ) . mind you , that mistranslation is inserted on the deutschlandlied page often enough ( only to be quickly reverted ) . but there is nothing wrong with above all . best ,

well , yes . sorry , as a non-expert , non-german speaker ( like most english-speaking wiki readers ) , these two powerful ships - as equipped - were less than battleships ( for whatever reason ) , and were not intended to be used as such by the kriegsmarine . they were , i suggest , intended to see off cruiser escorts and destroy convoys . to me , to call them battleships is confusing - they were not the equal of the bismarcks nor even of the kg5s . they certainly had the capability to be upgraded to proper battleships , it was a design feature and , i think , work did start on the gneisenau . i accept that the german term schlachtkreuzer translates directly into battleship , so what ? this is the english language wiki and should convey meaning to english speakers . battlecruisers were at a disadvantage to battleships : see hood and scharnhorst - and to me , that's the point . perhaps english/ german understandings of the term have diverged , and it's a language issue . after all the graf spee , scheer and lutzow/ deutschland have had differing descriptions in english ( pocket battleship or heavy cruiser ) and german ( panzerschiff ) . i had thought that the accepted way forward was to explain the differing views , when appropriate . lastly , i object to the insinuation ( perhaps not a serious one ) that , because expert (?) comments on one side of the debate are not right here , the debates that have been carried on elsewhere ( above , below and elsewhere ) can be ignored .

: it's starting to appear that you're arguing with someone else ? all the information is included in both versions , except , unfortunately , for the actual name for the parthian empire in iranian ( i.e. , not transliterated ) , so it can't be a matter of accuracy .

: perhaps the briefest report on hajo banzhaf's use of jungian archtypes in his interpreting this card , with a succinct quote fromtarot and the journey of the hero would help tie this article to specifics . i've read some joseph campbell but missed what he says of tarot : perhaps the reference could be more specific . - in the sub-section description and symbolism , let's have a clearer , less private description of the second meaning of the word .
