i agree - the first photo is very ordinary . i think what has happened is that the page originally linked to an image in wikimedia commons titled uluru2 . jpg ( which is quite a decent picture ) and that someone has uploaded a different image with the same name directly to wikipedia , so the link has switched over . pete , if you put the best of your pics to commons then an editor can take their pic(k ) and change the link .

= = states = = courts : i have been putting all articles dealing with state law and state courts and their judges under the ' foo law ' sub-category for each us ' foo ' state . this at least puts everything involving law and its administration in one place . while the courts are of course part of ' government ' , in some states their articles were so dominating the government category , that the executive and legislative articles were losing out . i can certainly see putting a ' see also ' notice at the top of each ' government of foo ' category to point to the ' foo law ' category . communications : communications , of course , encompasses media , and also telephone ( area codes ) and mail ( zip codes ) and internet , etc . i see no differenece to be made at the us level versus the state level . not sure that media is of such overwhelming importance at the state level , however , that it needs to be in multiple places or at the state level . thanks
