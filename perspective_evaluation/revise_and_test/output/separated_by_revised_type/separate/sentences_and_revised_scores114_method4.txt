would you agree there is nothing in your suggestions that justifies calling the article in its present state an advertisement ? i think we can continue to work on it , but the tag can be dropped . - i don't agree with this statement at all . right up until the article was locked , i was removing brochure language - see my edits . as diana pointed out , there is more brochure language that needs to be removed . what concerns me is that if the article is unlocked , your team will try to undo all the edits that brought the article closer to a non-advertisement . there's a lot more to be done here not even counting reverting the edits i know are forthcoming from the waldorf support pov lobbiests . again , the brochure-like language of the article has been in question here for at least three months and the waldorf project team was supposed to address this . the best way to address this , however , might be to have non-waldorf people look at it instead of a project team populated with waldorf people . why not show some good faith and not force the removal of the tag while the necessary edits are taking place ? just a thought .
