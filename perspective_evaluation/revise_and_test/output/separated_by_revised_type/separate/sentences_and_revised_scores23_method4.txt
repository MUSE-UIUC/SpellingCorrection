: so ... that's definitely a possible fundamental group of a 3-manifold . but if you consider all the other conditions of the fibering conjecture , it's not allowed . h_1 infinite means there's a non-separating surface ; irrreduciblity means it can't be a sphere . compressing the surface gives a pi_1-injective surface , so the 3-manifold group contains a surface subgroup , which can't be the case if it's the integers ( since the sphere is excluded ) . actually , the conclusion that the manifold fibers implies that the group contains a surface subgroup . the surface can't be a sphere ( because of irreducibility ) , so we have a more complicated surface whose fundamental group injects into the fundamental group of the 3-manifold .

well , i think it's sad that a culture has been created here that's so hostile to people merely wanting to bring balance that they feel forcedinto a ' poster-protection program ' but i respect your position . please stay and continue your great work . i'm not afraid of these pov warriors . their fear of me however has turned them into paranoics seeing ' big daddy ' in anything and everything they encounter that's fair at wikipedia . in the meantime , i'm gonna go back in later and clean up any mess that's been left , unless you beat me to it . take care

i do not agree with the section commenting why fw de klerk decided to end apartheid . article needs to be corrected to reflect that .. a ) .. fw de klerk taking the reigns of the national party ( np ) was in fact a coup d'état by senior members of the np effectively ousting pw botha b ) .. it was not his decision , but one that was made by him and by sernior party members c ) .. the major deciding factor for the np was the fall of communism , called the red danger ( die rooi gevaar ) , ceased to be a threat ( the cold war has ended , the berlin wall came down , etc )
