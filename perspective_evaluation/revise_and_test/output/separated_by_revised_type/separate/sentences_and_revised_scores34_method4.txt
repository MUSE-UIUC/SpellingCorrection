just look at the stuff about david irving and how many times the author tries to smear this honourable historian , whose book ' hitlers war ' from 1977 was compulsery reading at west point and sandhurst . this really says a lot of the extent of authority as mr. irving enjoyed ( then ) . he is still widely believed to be one of the greatest authorities on ww2 and of the nature of the nazi regime . all this still stands , as everyone can witness for himself by reading some of his books , which are available free of charge from his website as downloads . however one chapter of the aforementioned book was about the holocaust . and because of that david got subjected to a smearing campaign hitherto unseen in scope . booksellers was pressured not to sell his books ( no mention of this on wikipedia ) - that is why he gives them away for free . whereever he goes in the world he find arrangements cancelled ib short notice , the hotelliers or universities being pressed to pull the event . i find david irving to be a good and honourable englishman . his father was naval officer who took part in the battle of jutland . you cannot find any factual fault in his work . if you can david is the first who wants to know - email him . by the way , he do not deny the holocaust , which is why your wikipedia entry is so wrong . he find the whole subject boring , but hardpresset he will tell you that it should be spelled with a small h as there were many holocausts , poles , russians , gypsies and others got killed . civilians allways get caught out in war , but it is undeniable that the nazi regime was especially brutal . to be a folk without a homeland living among a majority is allways a precaurious situation to be in in times of unrest , or so history has proven many times . david akcnowledges that many jews got killed , but he happen to hold the view that most died from mal-nutrition and diseases , and that aplyes to all inmates in concentrationcamps . so you see he is not denying .

hmm . which part of my assertion denied that duryodhan was a kuru and the victorious pandavas were not ? thats my point regarding understanding english , rather than your's of fabricating lineages . i'm afraid other than names on a page even you cannot prove 100% who you are a direct descendant of . it is not 100% guaranteed and no dna scientist will stand with you on that one at all . btw , if maharaja janamejaya ( my ancestor ) was referred to as the ' king of the kurus ' then that would indicate that he was king over all kuru's . even your exiled ancestors too ) so less attacks , less provocation and let's for the sake of the article do some decent groundwork and clean it up . this page has deteriorated enough .
