:: mantanmoreland , please read wp : agf . you cannot know for certain what irishpunktom's motivations are , much less tell if that particularly violent euphamism is an appropriate one . wp : agf asks us to assume irishpunktom's motives are honorable , unless there's evidence to prove otherwise . we should assume the question is a reasonable one .

:: skookum1 2nd note : about the above . there's situations , again with somena mentioned elsewhere , where the people and government are somewhat indeterminate and well as indistinguishable ; in the somena's case because they're not a legal government , but one of the ancient social divisions of the peoples of the cowichan valley ; what we might call a chieftaincy but that's an imposed concept ( if you read the somena page you'll see what i mean .... i think ) . bottom line is , frankly , we're imposing a rational order based on our concepts ( separate concepts ) of ethnicity , language and government ; in some first nations culture that's a lot harder to do ; so the somena are not a first nations government in the white man's way of thinking , or even in the thinking of the union of bc indian chiefs ( which is an organization of whiteman-system band governments and tribal councils created by the indian act , the reserve system , and government agents et al ); but it would be touchy to exclude the somena from equal status in a template , say , with their neighbours/kin the quamichan . all too confusing for a cultus whiteman at this hour of the night so i'm going to bed now ....

here's another nice quote from li from the essentials : : most fundamentally , you all still need to establish your great mighty virtue in the process of shattering the old forces ’ persecution , and return to your highest positions . so this isn’t a matter of reaching consummation in ordinary realms , nor is it achievable in ordinary consummation . it might seem that you have done what you should do for dafa , when actually , you are doing it for your comprehensive consummation and return . if during this period you cannot do well with what you should do , this consummation stage can only be a cultivation process , and it cannot fundamentally be a fa-rectification disciple’s true and final consummation . if during the evil’s persecution a dafa disciple doesn’t do well or slacks off , it’s very possible all his previous efforts will have been for nothing . in other words , if you can't live up to the challenge of shattering the old forces's persecution you can't consider yourself a fa-rectiication disciple . and what distinguishes a fa-rectificatrion disiciple from an common ordinary disciple ? well , it's what you do to protect the master's fa against the evil forces , isn't it ? elsewhere the master actually says this is you duty as a practitioner . if there any practitioner/editor on this site who has the decency and honesty to acknowledge that these teachings are real and important for your salvation ? olaf , can you at least intervene and spare us from another endless series of endless discussions on this topic ?

clearly , some have an emotional or economic interest in minimising or even denying the importance of these consumer-oriented blind tasting competitions : the emperor has no clothes the owners of 30 of the best wines in the world , in the judgment of a champagne company president , were invited to a party in 1997 . the event was organized by jean-claude rouzaud to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his presidency of champagne louis roederer . half of his selections were from france . i’m a chauvinist and a nationalist he explained . before agreeing to participate , the bordeaux first growths set some conditions , the foremost being that no comparative tasting with their international competition would be held . they didn’t even want to be included in a group photo with their colleagues from other wine regions , although they finally reluctantly agreed . but getting the bordelais to have their wines served with the others ' , that was out of the question , said a roederer spokesperson . so the event took place in two separate parts : first , a dinner featuring the bordeaux wines ; then a tasting the next day with all the other wines , but no bordeaux . they are cowards , said a non-bordeaux producer . but the host said i understand them . he explained that they feel that when you are first growths you are untouchable . their problem is that they actually know better . they and the other named growth vineyards have a carefully cultivated image of superiority . this is a marketing advantage worth an incredibly enormous sum of money every year . however , they frequently fail to perform well in blind comparisons and realize how vulnerable they are to exposure and the destruction of their vaulted and very valuable reputations . because of this the named growths ( 1 ) want to avoid comparisons and ( 2 ) try to discredit the results of such comparisons . who can blame them ? those results can cost them a fortune in lost revenue . but the consumer benefits immensely . party in paris . wine spectator , 15-11-97
