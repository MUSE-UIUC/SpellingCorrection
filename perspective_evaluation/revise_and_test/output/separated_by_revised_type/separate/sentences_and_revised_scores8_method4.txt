yes , both anglicanism and anglican communion could do with a mutual tidy . i think that anglican communion should probably concentrate on the organisation , while anglicanism should in principle focus on the theology . both articles probably need a measure of history . like anglicans , it'll probably muddle through to a compromise in the end !

not below is another of squeakbox's lies and misrepresentations : i have absolutely no control over what others put on their board . what mr. van nattan writes are his own thoughts . my book was the standard reference of the 1980s on the new age movement . i disagree with mr. van nattan on many items , including what i consider catholic bashing . for anything written by him to be imputed to me is untrue and unfair . this is as logical as squeakbox imputing to me every ip address disagreeing with squeakbox from anywhere in michigan ( i.e. allen park , michigan , where i have probably been maybe 3 to 4 times in my career as a lawyer and no other contact certainly i have no ip address emanating from allen park , michigan . the detroit metropolitan area has at least 3.5 million residents . equally ridiciulous is imputation to me of things fro reston , virgina , and his biggest stretch was that if it came from toronto , it had to be cumbey as that is so close to detroit . clearly his major was not usa geography . as far as original research my research on solana was all culled and distilled from other works . synthesizing this is what encyclopedic research is about . i don't know what squeakbox is talking about as original research . does he mean i went to solana's house and office and took physical measurements . this is idiotic and he has turned wikipedia into an idiotic circus . i'm happy that he has nothing better to do with his time . as for me , i must practice law for an honest living !

::::::: joseph ratzinger became pope benedict xvi in 2005 . as you probably wouldn't call him benedict for the period of his life before 2005 because he simply wasn't pope from his birth , you shouldn't call charles emperor when referring to the foundation of the university in 1348 when he obtained this title only in 1355 . the fact that he founded the university as king of bohemia ( charles i ) played eminent role in the history of the institution and therefore is worth mentionig here .

the firmament is falsified by maxwell's equations which show that lorentz invariance must be the correct formulation of physical reality . many modern geocentrists falsely believe that michelson-morley establish the speed of light as the benchmark , but they are mistaken . since the firmament is falsified in such a way , it hardly makes sense to try to look at the purely gr-effect of gravitational lensing in this context . if the modern geocentrist doesn't believe in gr , they necessarily don't believe that physicists have the capability of modeling the universe described by any sort of rotation .
