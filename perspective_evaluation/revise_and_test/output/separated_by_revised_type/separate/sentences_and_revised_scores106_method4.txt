:: you are right , there is no consensus . for this reason there is a request for mediation . so far may i suggest that we find a compromise . imo a compromise is a little sentence about the expression , rather than any of the redirects we would prefer . if each of us impatiently opt for our own preference it will just be a never-ending revert war .

* in 1912 ( long before landis ) cobb attacked a fan in the stands and was suspended . the fan was indeed handicapped , but he was also hurling vile words at cobb , who wouldn't put up with it . his teammates went on a one-day strike , then came back when told they would be banned from baseball if they didn't . cobb did not escape suspension , he served it . the allegations against cobb and speaker in the mid-1920s came from another ballplayer , about a game several years earlier . it was that one player's word against theirs , hence insufficient evidence . landis didn't hesitate to punch out the big stars ( like ruth ) when it seemed warranted . the stats for jackson in the ' 19 series don't suggest he did anything much to help his team win . i don't know that he denied throwing the series , some sources claim that . but did he keep the money ? far as i know , he did . there is a rule that banned players can't be in the hall , because their actions are on the field , and are a stain on the game .

that is not an unambiguous defense of goldhagen's work . that there has been criticism of goldhagen's critics is certainly true - you can add bartov to that list , as well . that is also not the same thing as saying that goldhagen's work was actually good .
