cognizant of ongoing discussions , i've revised the article lead to correctly embrace the geographic/cultural duality of cyprus : as these discussions demonstrated , it is of eurasia . also note that added details are in the geography section of the article , particularly notations that the island is/was a crossroads with varied european , asian , and african influence . thanks . | |

it looks pretty good . as you mention , each entry in the disambiguation page should have enough information so that anyone looking for a specific entry will immediately know which one to click . a little extra detail is better than too little information . ptolemaic could probably be redirected to ptolemy ( disambiguation ) .

:: thanks for the comment . i think has made this a little too personal and i'm not even sure why . this is part of a broader content dispute and he has made some statements that can only be interpreted as taking sides due to clear misunderstandings ( the users initiating that page are not iranians , but , on the contrary , are minority groups - so he's reading the whole thing completely backward ) . i'm not sure what i might have done to deserve this , but he tried to warn me against attacking the same user before but i did not think of it as an attack and gave a full explanation as to why . no matter what happens here i'm going to be filing an rfc demanding an investigation into this . it looks to me like this user has a history of blocking people for unnecessary reasons . like i said this is unacceptable . i called that person a troll because he was indeed using provocative language ( pointing me out by name and then asking me to review wp : civil for making an edit he doesn't like ) , and i did not threaten him with a block - i was referring to his block on iranian peoples for violating 3rr . this is unacceptable .
