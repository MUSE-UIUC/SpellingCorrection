i suppose that is a rather extreme and uneccisary measure . perhaps a better mode of action might be to deal simply with the los angeles county relevant statements since they are the relevant ones concerning the mugshot of divine brown and a precedant could be set to look into the individual county on a case-by-case fashion when a new county's mugshot is under consideration . thank you for your help
