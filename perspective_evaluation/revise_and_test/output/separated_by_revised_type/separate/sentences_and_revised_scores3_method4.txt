i have some supporting evidence also , but he's a frenchman living in america . he feels socialism is , uhh , taking advantage of him . i'm afraid to ask him , but if necessary i will . first specify what type of proof is needed , and what type of monetary reward he may receive . ( why does it let me post without setting up an account ? )

: actually , i think it's okay to list there even if it's not an actual dispute , unlike most rfc listings . however , i've reduced it to a brief description of what you're doing , in keeping with the format of the page , otherwise it would get overwhelmed with chatter . but if you're trying to publicize this as a new project , i would recommend focusing on the village pump ( looks like you've already been there ) and wikipedia : goings-on .

: i think the paradox you are describing is similar to the problem called the ultraviolet catastrophe . this was the problem that , according to classical ( pre-quantum ) wave mechanics , waves of infinitely high frequency would have infinite energy , leading to an infinite amount of energy being emitted by any radiating body . it took quantum mechanics to explain why this would not happen .

ok , let's get it straight.is china proper a political term or geographical term ? if it is a geographical term , there is no way to include taiwan in china proper because tw is a island far from mainland . if it is a political term , there is a term used by qing empire called 內地十八省 , which means inland 18 provinces . here is the proof : http://edu.beida-online.com/data/data5.jsp?db=sanjiao&id;=gejx18 ( sorry it is the same link but a short while ago i didn't translate it right . ) 但有時卻只指傳統的 “ 中國 ” 范圍，即內地十八省，而不包括蒙古、西藏、青海、新疆、東北和台 灣在內。 translation : sometimes china only means the traditional area of china , which means inland eighteen province . it dosen't included mongolia , tibet , qinghai , xinjiang , manchuria and taiwan . here i have to emphasize the word inland , and that's why the qing officer didn't consider taiwan as part of the traditional area of china .

- if it was always called olzstyn in polish , i stand corrected . i was perhaps confusing it with ketrzyn , formerly ranstenburg . ( is this a transliteration into polish of allenstein , as frombork is a transliteration of frauenburg ? ) however , before 1945 the town was known to non-poles as allenstein , as a glance at any contemporary travel guide will attest . witness also the league of nations plebiscite in southern east prussia , which as shorthand was referred to as the allenstein district ( cf . churchill's memoirs ) . the plebiscite there in 1920 produced 97.8 percent ( 362,209 votes ) for germany and 2.2 percent ( 7,980 votes ) for poland . 10 these are facts , widely reported at the time and cited in countless historical accounts since then . by the way , it would be interesting to know what happened to the masurians who used to live there .

: from a certain topological viewpoint , a coffee-cup is the same as a donut . that doesn't mean we can't distinguish between the two when we have breakfast , because there are physical consequences to the transformation from one to the other . in the same way , saying that there is a topology-preserving transformation that sends interior to exterior of a sphere is non-controversial — but it doesn't mean that we can't distinguish interior from exterior because there are physically observable consequences to such a coordinate transformation .
