i'm perfectly cool there dude ... i just have an issue with people like collectonian who claim the wikipedia mos of wikipedia policy says something needs to be done a certain way yet absolutely refuses to show where . then when i persist that they give me a source they go run their mouth to discredit me or cry that i'm harassing and threatening them . she is full of shit . and you guys probably don't even know what the deal is because you just catch bits and pieces of stuff .

shit, ; 

scjessey , your tests changed nothing , in fact it looks worse . the episode list should span the width of the entire page , not be bunched up to the left and looking all retarded . you don'y seem to understand what i've been asking , but at this point , as far the bs has gone today , i no longer give a crap what happens to this article anymore . so do whatever you want . to be honest , my issue really wasn't how this article looked , it was trying to call out certain people around here like collectonian who claim they are enforcing wikipedia policy and following standards that i know are complete lies and fabrications , but those of you in charge just let it go on . so be it .
