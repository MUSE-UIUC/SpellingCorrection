: those sources might be interesting to those working on the unitarianism and trinity articles , but in general i agree that it's a little much for this one . the manner in which it's presented is also problematic-it would appear the statements are being made in wikipedia's voice , not in the source's voice . this could be solved by properly attributing the claims rather than stating them as simple fact- x , y , and z conclude that abc ... , not just abc is how it is . i think that the texts , being sourced , are worth a short mention here , but with more npov work done to them .
