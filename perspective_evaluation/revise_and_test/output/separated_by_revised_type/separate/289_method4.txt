:: so you blocked me because i reverted wtf's edits ? if that's the case , then why isn't also being blocked ( not that i'm suggesting you do so) ? i reverted the user's edits twice ( which , in that context , is not in violation of any policy that i know of ) , but please remember that i wasn't the only one reverting them . they were against established consensus , as pointed out by during the an3 discussion , and who reverted them for the third time . if all users involved are to be mentioned out of fairness , why have this user's reverts not been brought up ? this wasn't two users both reverting each other's edits back and forth . i'm perfectly aware of telling wtf to shut [ his ] hole , which could be considered a breach of civility ( depending on which admin you ask ) , but a personal attack worthy of a block ? the comment was made in response to repeated instances of yelling and accusations of vandalism on my talk page ( here ) , when i had done nothing to warrant any arguing on behalf of the user making the comments . i never even contacted . all i did was react to irrelevant complaints being listed on my talk page . quite frankly , this entire situation seems to be a case of wp : cdb , if you don't mind me saying so .
