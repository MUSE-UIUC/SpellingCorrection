it looks like howrealisreal proved the point of the original poster for them - from what i read here it doesn't seem like the original poster is saying they have all the facts - what they're doing is asking you to back up your facts ( quoted ex : where did they come up with this historic name ? ) with a substantial reference ( rather than an aol reference ) before putting it in something that's supposed to be an encyclopedia , and you just proved their point for them . as for signing posts - well remember you could sign a post with an ip address , but that means nothing because millions of aol users could have that exact same ip address on any given day , so it really makes no sense to sign an ip address on to these comments because you can't distinguish who it belongs to .

:: thanks qbasicjedi for your explanation . that makes sense . for those readers who did not understand qbsicjedi's detailed writing , i will simplify what i understood . when you look at a crescent moon , the poles are at the intersection of the two arches – one the outer boundary and the other formed by the terminator . however , the way an observer see these points “ up or down ” depends on where he stands on earth and which direction he looks at the moon .
