jossi , 50% of wiki seems to me to be unreferenced . whenever anyone states a clearly obvious uncontested fact in wiki , which is what about 50% of wiki is , unless someone can show the logical fallacy of the statement being presented as fact , it is usually not removed due to lack of documentation . for example , if i write that the dravidian culture of india is centered towards the southern end of india , i generally won't document it , as it is already a well known fact amongst those who know about india . now if i were wrong about this in an article , then perhaps someone would first point out specifically that they have heard that the dravidian culture is centered in the north of india , and could i please document my claim that it is centered in the south . but simply to remove without even saying why , that doesn't seem to me to comply with general wiki practice . could you please tell me exactly which facts in the above section you are finding trouble with and why ? : thanks , : -

.
