well , my arbitration request was deleted . user jayjg ( his edit history is replete with pro-israel wikipedia censorship ) deemed the addition of nisman's religion racist and banned me . further , user thatcher131 deemed that since i had been banned , i would not be given an arbitration request , even though the arbitration request . so now it is impossible to even get a hearing on whether this information should be included . this whole affair is really beyond sad and is an indication that pro-israeli censors are not interested in truth , but are rather interested in imposing their will . having now dealt with you first hand , i am no longer confused as to why most of the civilized world holds a negative view of israel and israelis . may fate continue to justly bring misery to your oppressive lives .

just because a child grows up doesn't mean it stops being a sibling . it just becomes an adult and begins to be treated as an equal by it's parent . i'm sure those ex - colonies would be very different places with very different people had the uk never existed . therefore by grace of building those countries the uk is a parent country . doesn't mean to say those countries are children , they once were , however now they are adult nations themeselves and are now treated equally as a result

the debate on the deletion under g7 , begun at 07:40 utc on 4 november 2006 , did not throw any light on the applicability of rule g7 , as most respondents confined themselves to other considerations ( notability of the subject , suitability of the article for wikipedia , etc . ) . no one managed to disprove the applicability of the csd g7 rule , and it should have properly overridden all other considerations . admitted , in a remarkable access of frankness , that the whole matter at hand was not about wikipedia policies at all but about his personal sense of injury ( writing at 13:08 utc 8 november 2006 , ‘ but that’s entirely to do with editors not wanting to be abused ’ ) .
