( i wrote defence above instead of defense since it looks like that article was originally created using british spelling . the wikipedia practice is to conform to the spelling that was used to create the article . if the article is about a clearly british subject , british spelling should be used , and the reverse if it's a u.s. subject . )

do you accept the stereotype that women are innately less sexually driven than men ? you write that almost all transsexual women want the sex drive reduced significantly , and reasons for this are psychological . we are not becoming ' something else . ' yet if your sex drive is reduced significantly , then you are becoming something very unlike a real women . why ? because healthy real women have sex drives just as strong as men's , if not stronger . you are becoming a man who has been chemically and cosmetically altered into a facsimile of femininity ; a stereotypical pseudo-woman . you are not a real woman ; you are a man with a low sex drive and clearly an equally low opinion of real women . you never stopped to ask yourself whether ' female hormones ' would have the same effect on your adult male body as they do on genuine females . you never paused to wonder whether your male body requires different testosterone levels compared to a woman's in order to achieve the same level of sex drive . after all , one of the cardinal beliefs of the sex change industry is that men and women are different right ? so why do you consider these differences only when they favor your delusions ? so

decided to delete some of the older material seeking to distinguish genre fiction from other forms of fiction that have common elements . the definition and conventions of genre are discussed under their own headings . also deleted material suggesting that genre conventions are essentially a time-saver for writer and reader ( not having to define or explain certain things ) . it seems rather that the stability of genre conventions comes from the fact that readers like those elements , rather than that they are simply familiar with them . deleted the heading genre in general , since this material is covered in the separate article for genre . deleted the paragraph discussing fantasy fiction and its evolution , since this is covered in depth in the fantasy fiction article . still working on the heading the evolution of fiction genres . it's a work in progress .
