vince - fyi ' yellowfrogs ' is ( longdendale ) councillor sean parker perry , a frequent purveyor of ' greenwash ' and four square behind the destruction of swallows wood via his support for the bypass . he is vigourously re-editing the wikpedia pages on the longdendale bypass , his own and roy oldham's page in order to boost his fake ' green ' credentials and obfuscate the neutrality of these articles . he gets nasty if he gets pissed off ( threatens spurious legal action ) , but fortunately , he's legally illiterate , so don't be put off .

hi , the new section title sounds good to me , but i'm still in favor of removing the charles taylor quote . it makes mr. taylor appear like a living legend , which perhaps he is , but it's odd that he's not referred to in such glowing terms on his own wikipedia article ( or maybe not : it's a very contentious statement from a periodical , not a person ) . the second part of the quote seems like empty praise to me , not really encyclopedia grade material . neither part passes the sniff test , so i removed it again . also , from your comment , it appears that you think the article is unbalanced because positive material is not being included . is that what you think , that there is not enough positive material about mr. wilber in the article ? i thought the whole goal was npov , neither positive nor negative , just the facts . it's not supposed to sound like an ad , nor like an attack piece , and to that end , both this quote and negative quotes like mr. wilber is full of himself will get stricken .

being reasonable is good . make sure , though , that you do not lapse into the same kind of behavior that lead to your recent block . how would it look to others if you came off a block and started doing the same things again ? a general attitude of incivility is what's not accepted here- it's not about using one particular word or another . if you get a 24-hour block and don't use the opportunity to cool down a bit , you're only giving people reason to try a longer block .
