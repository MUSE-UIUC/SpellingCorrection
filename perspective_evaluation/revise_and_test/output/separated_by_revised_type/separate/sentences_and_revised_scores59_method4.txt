it's a stupid project . wikipedia should be a hub of information for all ages . if it is filled up with porno articles with inappropriate material , both encyclopedic and for the reading of the general population , child or otherwise , then it is restricting the audience of wikipedia surely ? i mean how can a source of information be free and accessible to all , if it is ostensibly linked with explicit material , most of which shouldn't be in the encyclopedia . ps - i know about wikipedia's no censorship issue , but sometimes it goes too far .
