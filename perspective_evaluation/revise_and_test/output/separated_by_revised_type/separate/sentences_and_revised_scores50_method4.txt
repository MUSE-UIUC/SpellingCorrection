it's a good thought , but it's a common marketing ploy to put the name of the movie's well-known director/writer/producer in the front of the title to attract attention ( like stephen king's the green mile , mario puzo's the godfather , etc . ) . so the title probably shouldn't be changed - otherwise , we'd have a glutton of movies ( 7 in this case ) starting with that person's name .

, 17 march 2006 ( utc ) :: well , i was thinking in terms of those who believe in the avatarship of hariakhan baba and his being the same as lahiri mahsaya's guru . he was already teaching long before yogananda was even born , in fact even before lahiri mahasaya started his ministry . there are accounts of panchanon bhattacarya as well as tincouri and ducouri lahiri handing prayaschitta money directly to babaji , and also a personal visit of babaji to the house of lahiri mahasaya witnessed by pranavananda . so it is somewhat safe to conclude that mahavatar babaji was a normal human being intermingling with people in civilization , though probably exaggerated thru time . so , what we need here is a book published before autobiography of a yogi saying that the baba of hariakhan is lahiri mahasaya's guru ? what if i can provide that ? i mean , maybe not verbatim but clearly implying that idea . :: 14:39

nlu : i've made edits to the alkyl nitrites/poppers page that you have called ' vandalism ' . however , each of those edits is based on sound evidence . it appears that this is a ' content dispute ' mistaken for ' vandalism ' . i am interested in finding a solution that fits within wikipedia policies . i would appreciate it if you would explain why you consider the subject edits to be ' vandalism ' , so that i may understand where you're coming from . if we're not able to come to consensus , i would recommend that we consider any number of the wikipedia options for dispute resolution , including but not limited to , informal mediation , discussions with third parties , requesting an advocate , and finally , if none of this helps , using wikipedia's last resort , arbitration . thank you .

i would have thought it had been obvious why it wasn't released on the cube- storage space . gamecube games can only hold 1.5 gig on a single disc , and the abundance of speech in psychonauts would have been too large to ship on one disc .
