it depends how you define world . the war which commenced in 1939 was only between european states , while the two most industrially powerful countries on the globe ( usa and soviet union ) were not at war . it only becomes an actual world war in 1941 . it could be rationally argued that if the war had ended before 1941 , before the usa and su got involved , then it would just have been called the european war , or the great nazi war , or the anglo-franco-german war or something similar . it is difficult to see why a war which leaves out the two most powerful countries on earth could in any real sense be called a world war . ( and i am writing this as a european . ) still , the war has to be called something , and once it became a world war in 1941 then the name could retrospectively be applied to the fighting which preceded it .
