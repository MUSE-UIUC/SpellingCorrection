yeah hir isn't a blog at all - it's a collection of pieces on current events and history in a scholarly style with references . if we separate the links as cmart says then everyone will know very well exactly what kind of link they are going to , so i think we should just add it and divide the links into pro-israel and pro-hezbollah .
