i have a book of willy ley's called the lungfish , the dodo and the unicorn : an excursion into romantic zoology . this sounds similar to the book exotic zoology but was first published in 1948 , with a second printing in 1951 . are they the same book , perhaps with revisions and a less-silly title ?
