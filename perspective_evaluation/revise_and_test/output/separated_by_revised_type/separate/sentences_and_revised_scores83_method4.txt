that's rich , accusing arthur ellis of privacy violations when you continually allow people to out him , including today on the kinsella page . i believe he is taking moves to deal with you directly , in person , and not through your assumed identity on wikipedia .

why should a blog get such treatment ? ( ie replacement or it stays ) wp : rs says no blogs period , and i know wp : el says that under exceptional circumstances could blogs be allowed , i am assuming they mean quality blogs like [ www.realclimate.org realclimate ] in the article about global warming . not blogs that do not provide any insight into the subject at hand mainly du . there is a connection but its only purpose is to highlight du extremism which is not good enough , for a npov and quality encyclopedia .

:::: ok , then the section should be condensed to discuss the aspects in particular where d contributes to generic programming . if dmeranda is correct in that static if is a completely other take on generics then that point need to be discussed and exemplified , and i'm not certain if the factorial example is an adequate illustration of this since i failed to get that point . also , the alias parameters seems to be of relevance and a discussion about these should be added . static derival of return types risks venturing into pure language comparisons since c++0x will be equipped with a of_type ( forgot what it is to be named ) static operator and other languages have this facility too . thus in short , the section should be condensed , sharpened to drive the relevant points home , and a better example should be found ( invented ? ) . i am doing a bold edit to test your reaction : since the d templates section is in all a commentary on the c++ templates section , i'm moving it to that section as a corollary . it makes more sense like tat the way it is written atm . feel free to revert if you disapprove of this .
