= = more on math markup = = i saw your table at flue gas emissions and it looks nice . that led to your discussion of wiki's less than perfect math markup . you pointed out that your png generated at wikicities was more compact : than the example you provided with wiki markup : so i played around and came up with this example : which may not be perfect , but it is alot closer to your first one . cheers . : i believe placing a message on a userpage is the only way to create the message notice . many users do put responses directly under the message for continuity , but they would still need to place a notice on the other userpage to get a quick response . : the smaller font is achieved with the \begin{matrix } \end{matrix } tags . ( note braces not parens - they are hard to distinguish on my monitor ) . this is noted in help : formula #fractions , matrices , multilines section under small fractions , where it adds that the tag forces \textstyle . i am no expert , so i can't provide further guidance . : concerning the power plant article , you could provide a more prominant link to your article ( i will demonstrate ) , but i think the main article should remain an overview with links to subsidiary articles .

* as a russian speaker from ukraine , i'd like to add that the spelling is odessa style , due to the hard r , not that it's really relevant . also , the meaning would more idionatically translate as it would make chickens laugh or , in other words , even chickens would laugh at it - meaning it's very absurd . maggie
