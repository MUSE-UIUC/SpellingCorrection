:: i think some of the confusion here arises from a difference in british/american english . in britain , a hot chocolate drink such as cadbury's drinking chocolate would never be sold as hot cocoa . hot cocoa in the uk is a different drink , made directly from powdered cocoa , which generally needs to be sweetened by adding sugar . as the hot chocolate article points out , the terms hot chocolate and hot cocoa are used interchangeably in the us , even on the packaging of brands such as swiss miss .
