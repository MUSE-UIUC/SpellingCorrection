this article , and the main article that i'm preparing this for , is somewhat of a personal and family mission . in the interest of full disclosure , i started this talk page to explain my conflict of interest and what i am attempting to do . pauli murray was one of my paternal aunts . i share the opinion of many that she is a historical figure as well . i have quite a bit of personal , anecdotal knowledge of this subject . however , i'm attempting to reconcile that knowledge with verifiable fact . building this timeline is the first step in that process . i intend to refine it over time , building references and expanding the main article to include more comprehensive information . on the one hand , i acknowledge that my contributions in this area are intensely personal and could easily be colored by my personal knowledge of the person in question . at the same time , i recognize my responsibility to the wikipedia audience and i fully intend to do an objective as well as comprehensive job as i possibly can . i welcome any assistance and/or guidance that anyone can offer .

: jorfer's complaint above is actually deeper than just whether or not 0.999 ... = 1 . his issue , rather , is rather the concept of limits actually applies to real life . he is agreeing that the series ( 0.9 , 0.99 , 0.999 , ... ) has a limit of 1 , but he is not agreeing that the corresponding decimal 0.999 ... should be said to be equal to 1 , but that they must instead differ by some as yet undefined infinitesimal amount . : the reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an infinitesimal quantity must be equal . the article archimedean property has a section that explains why the reals have no non-zero strictly positive infinitesimal numbers . since 0.999 ... and 1 differ by at most an infinitesimal quantity , and the only such quanity in the reals is zero , 1 - 0.999 ... = 0 and thus 1 = 0.999 ...
