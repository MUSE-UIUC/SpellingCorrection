= = hey yoshi , many thanks ! = = i've seen you a lot on the zelda articles and felt like i'd drop by and give a quick thanks . in many of those discussions , you seem to be the voice of reason . so yeah ... thanks ! and just a note on your user page ... are you sure your japanese name would be yosshi ? ' cause they do have the syllables ' yo ' and ' shi ' , so you could probably drop the small ' tsu ' . just a suggestion ; i've only taken a semester of japanese , so you might know more than me .
