added 2007 : this observation is 100% correct . porn is not some slick hollywood pr machine , it is mainly lies to hook gullible horney guys with fantasies , but not real facts ( second source , at least for porn information , be damned . it plain ain't true ) .

hi romguig , why did you undo my edits to la plagne . the information was taken from the la plagne piste map ( 2006-2007 version ); and from my knowledge - i lived in la plagne last year , and know a lot about the place .... maybe some of the info is original research , so that can be deleted , but the infobox is useful and i think it should remain in the article .

:( i hope this is the right way to reply ) : good question . no , of course , it does bump up the principal . how about this thought experiment : for continual compounding , what if the payment is not made continuously ? i only mean this rhetorically . the fact is , the payment period and the compounding period do not need to coincide at all ; the compounding period is a convention . i hope i express this properly , and i do not do this on a day to day basis , but my understanding is : : the compounding per se is on a six month basis , but can be calculated at any time . : so , if you are late three days ( and no grace period , etc ) , the amount payable is added to principal for this period of time . if you ask the bank ( and their systems are up to date ) , you can determine new principal , which is old principal plus payment amount plus accumulated interest to that day . : if you pay on the third day , you will have interest payable on the original principal plus the delayed payment for three days at the six-month compound rate ( expressed as a fraction of days / six months ) . : in fact , this is basically identical to interest on a given sum for x% annual interest for y days . you would pay interest of principal times x% times y/365 . it just doesn't get compounded for the interim days ( for example , on a daily basis ) . : why six months , etc ? i have no idea . that was the convention a long time ago and it has stuck , and i think at one point they chose to require banks etc to all quote and calculate on the same basis , rather like an apr . : the point being any rate/compounding period can be chosen , the calculations are just extra work often dictated by convention/regulation . hope this is clear .
