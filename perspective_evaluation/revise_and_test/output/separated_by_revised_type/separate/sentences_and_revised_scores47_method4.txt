i renamed this page from havre , farm , norway for several reason . the name was not standard wikipedia format ( the , farm , norway part of it ) , havrå is an unique name ( see havre ) , after googling both havre and havrå , the havre (+osterøy ) search led mostly to pages in norwegian about the name change , while the havrå search led to both english and norwegian pages about the farm . therefore i assume that havrå is the standard name in english . the old name is now a redirect
