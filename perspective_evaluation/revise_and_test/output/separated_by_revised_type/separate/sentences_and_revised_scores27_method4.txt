most likely this study doesn't come up in review papers because the iq scores are so far from the population mean(s of whites and blacks ) that it becomes hard to interpret them broadly , rather than as some kind of bias during adoption . imagine if you did a study of heart disease and found your control and experimental group lived to be 90 and 100 years old respectively .

boothyboy you are wrong , as heard on the wonderful opie and anthony show on xm 202 , the leading provider of satellite radio , howard stern will not have any rights to his old show , it is something that is and was non-negotiable . the great inventor must steal some more ideas from greg and tony .

::: i sympathize with your position , it's a lot of work to take on . but at the same time , it would probably make more sense to work on these in user-space and then move a properly stubbed out article into article-space as you complete it . these aren't even stubs imo , except for stating that it's an episode of a series and which episode it is and which season it's from , these articles are largely blank . someone expecting an article ( or even a short stub ) will probably be annoyed by articles like this . ( and again , alternately , someone looking to contribute may assume these articles are finished since all the links appear , at first glance , functional ) . the work to setup the article formatting is small in comparison to actually writing the content for all the sections listed . in any event , i notice my csd tags are being reverted en masse – i'll likely follow through on the afd nominations and let them settle it ( and we can both make our cases heard there as well ) . again , i have total faith that you ( and those who edit these articles ) really intend to finish them up , but most of these have been sitting stagnate for 2-3 months now . working on these in user-space ( e.g. - for example ) and then moving them ( either literally using page move , or copying the content as needed ) would probably be easier on you as well as users browsing the episode listing . — ( e-mail )
