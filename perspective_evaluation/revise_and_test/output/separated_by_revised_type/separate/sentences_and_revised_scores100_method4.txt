::: uh , it's actually your opinion of someone else's opinion that the said quote establishes that one person's words actualy are trying to convey that fangio was the best . and , good luck with that . as i demonstrated above , i totally destroyed the argument of his greater wc average . plus , as most people know in racing , half of schumacher's racing career he was racing with sub-par cars . he went from a winning team to a losing team and turned them into the winningest team ever .

i don't think it would be necessary to merge them . they are technically seperate , with the futures team now being a ' past article ' in that the sfa have abandoned the idea of a ' futures team ' in order to concentrate on the national under-19 and under-21 teams . so if someone would care to add more info to the futures team page , it would be recognised as it should be - seperate from the national team .
