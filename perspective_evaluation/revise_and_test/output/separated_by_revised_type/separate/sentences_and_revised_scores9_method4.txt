well , i certainly wasn't denying that this kind of thing can happen . i was just noting that nobody seems to say anything one way or the other about her close relatives , and that the whole thing seems to be cherry-picking . it's also rather anglocentric - it's not as though charlotte came out of a wild area where we know nothing of her other family members , and yet there seems to be no interest in whether she looked like a typical member of the family , or not . at any rate , i have no particular problem with some mention of this . i do think that it's pretty disproportionate at this point .

: remember how viruses work : they are merely little bits of genetic material that hijack the host cell's mechanisms and cause the host cell to start cranking out many , many new copies of the virus . eventually , the host cell bursts , releasing all the new virions ( virus particles ) to go infect new hosts . it's simply this rupturing of the host cell's membrane that kills it , and it's pretty-much the same story with any virus , from good old cold viruses ( rhinoviruses ) to hiv . :

: the thing is , just because some nomenclature has a historical pov does not mean that it has a current pov . for example , i can use the terms holy roman empire , thursday , or queen elizabeth ii without implying that i believe that the empire was holy , or that i worship the norse god of thunder , or that i recognize the authority of the british monarch . ( interesting note about the quakers in the thursday article though : should we scrub wikipedia of thursday ? ) regardless of the historical origins of the abbreviations bc and ad , they now mean little more than indicating the point at which the english-speaking world stops counting years backward and starts counting them forward . seriously , how many people read bc and think that the messiahship of jesus is being proclaimed ? or that ad means they accept jesus as lord ? construing bc and ad as statements of religious devotion may have been valid when the terms were first introduced , but to reject bc and ad now in the face of centuries of tradition and widespread usage seems to be justifiable only under two premises : either ( 1 ) that any term with historical origins in religious devotion carries an eternal pov taint and should be excised from wikipedia , or ( 2 ) that the abbreviations still so strongly communicate religious meaning to the majority of users as to make the terminology indeed pov . the first premise is itself pov ( by singling out religion as an unacceptable originator of terminology ) , and thus should not justify rejecting bc/ad . the second premise , though is where i think slrubenstein and others are coming from ( do correct me if i'm wrong ) . if this premise can be validated , then the pov-ness of bc/ad is established , and use of these abbreviations should be abandoned throughout wikipedia in favor of bce/ce . on the other hand , if bc/ad is shown not to convey religious meaning to the majority of wikipedia users , then it should be the favored usage in most articles based on its familiarity to readers . perhaps another poll could be taken to address the simple yes/no question : does modern usage of bc/ad convey a religious point of view to you ? assuming a sufficiently representative response by wikipedians , the results may be a better indication of how to resolve this controversy than simply asking for people's preferences between bc/ad and bce/ce .
