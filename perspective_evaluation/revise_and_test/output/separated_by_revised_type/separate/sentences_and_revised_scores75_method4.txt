i recommend to anybody wanting to know something about republican sinn féin history , to look at the previous versions of this page before the thought police deleted the article a short history of republican sinn féin . try to have a look at the article quoting from Éamon mccann , it really shows what good writing should be , not like what we have to endure on the main article here . its funny how damac and demiurge have left a cut and paste from brian feeney's book sinn féin 100 turbulent years . no worries about copy right here . guess it has nothing to do with the fact that the case they are trying to present , that adams didnt expel himself in 1986 , is entirely dependant on this quote from his book . that it is a weak case is obvious - thats why they have deleted all my efforts to set the record straight and have now threatened to ban me from wikipedia .

damn right you're doing something wrong . and you still haven't answered my question : why are you doing this ? just who do you thing is offended by unfair images ? i can see from your talk page that this is clearly a sad fixation of yours , so i'm not going to fight you - i really don't have the time , i've got better things to do , unlike you you sad little man . so delete my images if you must , but just answer me this - who are you benefiting ? ( apart from yourself obviously , satisfying your own sad delusional little ego trip that you're a ' virtual policeman ' - probably too pussy to be one in real life ) .
