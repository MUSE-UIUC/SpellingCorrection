hi , and welcome to wikipedia . i am a bit concerned with your rewriting of the 1936 summer olympics article . i have checked with statistics elsewhere , and they plainly put japan , and not the netherlands in eighth place . you should not change this article to make a point about japan having invaded korea .

:: my mistake . i came off sounding like a huge bush supporter there . i was just trying to correct the possible misleading statement of my fellow wikipedian . i have no problem including any of bush's approval ratings , but only when notable . i haven't looked at other presidents articles too much , but i suppose there should be some continuity between them . also , to say bush's low numbers right now are a direct result of the war in iraq is also misleading . many people , including many republicans , are upset with his stance on the border , social security , etc . life in 2005 is not all about iraq . feel free to quote me on that . 6 july 2005 15:07 ( utc )
