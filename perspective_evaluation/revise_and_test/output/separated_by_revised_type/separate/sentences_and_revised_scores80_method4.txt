: just to clarify , what i'm saying is that requests for deletion , editting , or anything other than creating pages in the article namespace should be declined . if you agree with the deletion request , feel free to send it to prod or afd , but do so only for yourself and not on behalf of an anon from afc . the reason for this is that banned users might use this as a loophole and use afc editors as a proxy for their mischief . that's trouble none of us need . thanks again for all your hard work .

i have not problem with the beowulf . it's says that hygelac was king of the geats . but he was properly also king of some danes , probably from skåne area , since it's also says that he was from the danish dynasty . and both saxo and anglo writers , call him dane and not geat . but no matter what . this can't be used to call all danes for scandinavians . its also 300 years before rollo . comanche cph
