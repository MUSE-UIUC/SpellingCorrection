hi i do not wish to argue however in the article itself , it implicitly mentions how the greeks retreated to mathura from pataliputra many times in the article which is sourced therefore by logic mathura should definately be within the border . i am not fabricating original research as it is all already in the article . it would be appropriate if you were to provide sources contradicting their occupation of such areas within those dates if the article is wrong . as for the lines drawn , as far as i've seen in books they are only used to show the movement of armies in detailed books of military campaigns and are never shown on a map depicting the extent of a kingdom . as mentioned before due to the other articles following such a rule the border should enclose pataliputra as an occupation period of 8 years is enough i think especially if many other pages include territories that have been held for only a year and these articles ( mentioned above ) have been peer reviewed .

quoting from the rules .. dealing with misuse of process unlike trolls who vandalize articles , the majority of the damage caused by those misusing process is indirect . generally it is best to simply state your opposition and leave it at that . in many cases someone else has already gone through an explanation , and you can simply say you agree . if a nomination or listing is obviously going to fail , piling on explanation after explanation or personally attacking the nominator is not going to change anything ; the listing or nomination will fail anyway . if the number of listings starts getting excessive ( even if they are on separate pages ) then you might want to use the dispute resolution process . dispute resolution does take a while , though . if the number of nominations/listing is very high the most damage will be done if there is no emergency block put in place . in general , let the process run . given the conversation in the ani was about me , and i was commmenting and responding to the ani on this page , quoting it was the reasonable thing to do .
