put up or shut up to all you people who think the president is doing such a terrible job . why don't you run for president and when you get elected try and do it better . it's really easy to play the monday morning quarterback . its one thing to disagree with his foriegn policy , it another to criticise him for decisions he made , when you don't know what information he had at the time . we may not have the best system , but at least we have a man who is not afraid of making the tough calls .
