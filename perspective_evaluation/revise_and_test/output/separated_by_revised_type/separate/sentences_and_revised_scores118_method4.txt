politically it can be argued that the uk government strongly supports the construction of wind farms projects to the detriment of much better alternatives . the underlying reason for this is to protect the treasury from potential large losses in tax revenue . significantly , alternatives such as energy efficiency initiatives , home based micro-generation and solar thermal power installations would reduce vat revenue from energy bills . moreover , these alternatives would cause considerable loss in tax revenue from the profits of energy supply companies that correspond to the reduced amount of energy these companies would otherwise supply .
