::::: i'm still not sure what you were after when you asked for an annotation ( or perhaps a new page ) regarding the origin of sion , but i guess you were wanting a link to the word zion . i assume that the annemasse hill ( like many others ) was named after the jerusalem hill , but since i have no evidence of that i just added a sentence about the origin of the name and the fact that the use of s rather than z has no special significance - it's just the normal way of spelling zion in french , as emphasised in earlier organisations such as the congregation de notre-dame de sion .
