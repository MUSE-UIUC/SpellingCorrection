i have written a text under the heading mettoy-corgi , but as this relates to ' corgi toys ' - the name of the brand from 1956 to 1983 ( ie ) the mettoy years , and clearly establishes mettoy ownership , maybe it should be filed under a heading ' corgi toys ' . nick crowe .

= = intro through gnu licenses phrase = = the first paragraph ended in a sentence about fsf helping the gnu project , through the use of gnu licenses ( see below ) . . i can't figure out the meaning of that , and it seems incorrect since fsf helps the gnu project in more ways that just using the gnu licenses . normally i wouldn't write a talk entry about removing such a sentence , but since it says ( see below ) , i wonder if there was previous controversy about the clarity/meaning of this sentence .

whoever changed the spelling in the article today also broke links . i think that's a pretty clear sign that the alternate spellings chosen are not common . a quick google search on each of the words changed also confirms this . it was an anon , or i'd bother to leave them a message on their talk page . there are other pages on wikipedia better devoted to spelling wars .

unlike some people , i read the frankish annals , chronicles of the priest of doclea and of managing an empire , and i enjoyed in every single one of them . this red croatia most probably never existed after all ( as a croatian state ) the other two historical sources are much more acurrate . we have the originals of them , and only a copy is preserved of the priest's statement . but i have made careful studies , and made conclusions from all three ( and agreed that all are completly correct ) i will display it here soon .
