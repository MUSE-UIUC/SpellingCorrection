shuki : well i am glad to see that you are up to speed on everything wikipedian ! here are some of my reactions to your comments : userpzfun says that he is an admin on his user page ( which i did look at before the critique ) , see : wikipedia : requests for adminship/pzfun . is that a lie ? nowhere do i accuse him of anti-semitism ( i see that you enjoy twisting around words ... hmmm , what a pity . ) while user : pzfun may well be a lover of jews , that does not mean that he gets a free pass when he does a weird thing to an article about a well-known rabbi . you may not know it or accept it , but the word goy or goyim is considered to be derogatory regardless of what you tell your non-jewish pals in chat rooms ( again more habitual word-twisting on your part i guess . ) what's nor ? i cannot read your mind . i don't accept any of your thinking about how to handle articles that we know nothing about . i suggest , when in doubt stay away , or else violate the age old saying that fools rush in where angels fear to tread . ( in hebrew it's more blunt : hedyot kofetz berosh . ) your statemnt that : again , baruch hashem , others jews aren't selfish and don't ignore the rest of wp , and baruch hashem , many goyim think the same way and contribute to jewish articles , especially w/r to structure , format , etc ... is hilarious and beyond the scope of this discussion . this is wikipedi and anyone can edit , do you think i don't know that ? so your musar , yet again , is quite amusing . i welcome constructive criticism , but do know that i am often quite frank and honest , as most people who have gone head-to-head with me know . finally thanks for asking me out , but lately i have been into freshly boiled kosher chicken soup more than falafel , so you are welcome to try mine any time . by the way , i don't care who you are in real life !

this is obviously a loving rewrite by someone , but i did a first pass for style/tone and pov . i also changed the british spellings of some words ( or australian perhaps ? ) . there is still a long way to go ; i didn't want to change it too much , especially at a first go . still a bit too effusive for an encyclopedic article .
