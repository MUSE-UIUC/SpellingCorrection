:: i scanned these photos from the elson book on a flatbed scanner . unfortunately , that means the halftone pattern from the photo being printed onto paper . the other two photos i could use a blur effect and fiddle around with contrast to reduce that problem and get some progress out of , but doing the same thing to the top photo ended up making it look very out-of-focus .

: the abbreviation phe is used outside the bitcomet area too ( mostly by users of other clients that heared about the future ) , but then it's usually expanded to encryption and not encrypt , i think we should point that out in the article and only mention the official expansion in the article header and then use encryption . that sounds better and is grammatically correct .

in response to your latest comment on my talk page : however enthusiastic i was in choosing/defending the choice of indonesian civil war does not make you any less able to propose a change . nevertheless , i knew that the choice was going to raise some hackles from any number of sides - so there are a good number of redirects to indonesian civil war , including g30s and g30s pki ( as far as i know , the most commonly used name for the time period/conflict ) . if there are other suggestions , then i'd like to hear them . but i do find it a personal annoyance to be criticized for trying to do something , without any particular guidance as to what the alternatives may be .

thanks very much , deb . i'll go ahead and make a few small changes then . the merger/redirect is certainly useful . thank you for your offer of help . we do have a few things that need fixed which are beyond our technical skills ! one anomaly is that the operetta categories are independent of the opera ones although operetta is supposed to be a genre of opera . it may be simple to bring the operetta branch back into the opera tree . i'd be grateful if you have any ideas ! best
