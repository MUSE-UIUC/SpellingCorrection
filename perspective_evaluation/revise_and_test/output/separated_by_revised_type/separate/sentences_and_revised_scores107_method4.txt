yeah , checked again to be sure i was logged in last time . yep . now to magically deduce whether i was auto-blocked or not auto-blocked , in whatever apparently arbitrary context is relevant . careful ! apparently choosing the wrong one will prevent the other from working . and here i was ready to flip a coin . i'm currently curious whether there's a super-really-verifiable un-blocker mechanism , or if my effort will earn me another random block - on my username ! what did i do ?!? - a month or so down the road . the next question is whether i earn less or more blocks when i don't edit a thing in a month .

*** littleoldme , i agree with you on this issue . it is not pov to say chavez is a mexican-american . it also doesn't single him out . the primary argument against the edit seems to be that his mexican heritage somehow detracts from him . this does not seem to be a viable argument . first , you assume there is a negative connotation to being from a mexican heritage . to assume some people might view this in a negative light ignores the reality that any statement on a page can be looked at in a negative light by a person . the fact you list chavez as an american will cause some people to look at him in a negative light . the same issue occurs with him being a union leader ( people are against the union ) . second , you ignore the fact far more reliable sources , dealing with far greater issues of a need for nuetrality have labeled him as a mexican american . if the library of congress can refer to him as a mexican american , why not wikipedia ? the library of congress is a reliable source , and not pov . it seems to me that the exclusion seems to be pov , in that it is pushing an unkown agenda . i don't know what the agenda is . third , didn't cesar chavez in cesar chavez : autobiography of la causa describe himself as a mexican american working to help other mexican americans . he had duel citizenship ( both usa and mexico ) . doesn't any of this matter ? these are facts , not pov .
