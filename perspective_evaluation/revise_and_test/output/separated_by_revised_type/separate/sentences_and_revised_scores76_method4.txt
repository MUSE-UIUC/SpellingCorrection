::::::: well , i didn't realize you were reaching for such an analytical perspective . that quote from l&c ; was from a different representation of the character , more approaching the john byrne cmics , in which the focus was placed more on the alter ego rather than the hero . bottom line the movie is released to the public on the 27th at 10 pm . that's established . clark kent isn't his real name either . by saying superman you know who i'm talking about so you don't need to throw an anal fit over it because if i say it's superman's son , you know who superman really is . you don't need to be so extremely retentive . so , let's just wait til the 27th , or the 28th however you want to look at it , because this is getting tiresome and i just want to wait and see the movie . so just stop .

= = propfan md-80 = = i read that during a period of unusually high fuel costs , md built one -80 with propfan engines ( these look like turbofans , but with a propellor attached to the rear ; they are known for their effeicency ) . after some initial hype , no orders came , and the model ( i believe it was a one-off , more of a demonstrator than anything else ) , was scrapped . there has been intermitent talk of using propfans on civil aircraft since then , but it has not come to anyhting .

: there's another sensible point . for the balt republics , their occupation by the soviets ( which was actually legal ) was considered illegal by western historians , and presented as such . so the fact that , for instance , moldova has not been invaded is not fully meaningful , because it was an invasion in fact . you cannot say romanians gave up by their own will . they were just waiting to fight back at a time where they would not have been destroyed .

ok . i don't feel that strongly that it should be removed . but , just so you know what i mean , in the case of the torture photos i think the graphic imagery is more pertinent to the article . the imagery is the proof , and the imagery is what caused the controversy . i think this is different . i don't think anyone would argue that we need severed limbs or entrails in this article either .
