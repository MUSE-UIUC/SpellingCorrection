in other words , you seem to have written the articles as though they were non-fiction topics taken from some fictional encyclopedia , whereas they really should read like fiction topics in a non-fictional encyclopedia ( wikipedia ) .

i was reluctant to add details on janjalani's involvement with bin laden . i don’t know how much is speculation ( specifically the 6 million$ financial donation by bin laden and janjalani's involvement with bin laden during the soviet invasion of afghanistan ) or fact . i'm assuming the article i read was reliable however if anybody's read anything further that disproves this remove the unreliable information .

my 2 cents : aaron's claim : y is true because : if x then y . mrvoluntarist's argument : if x then z ; z is false ; therefore not x . thus aaron's argument is invalid . note that mrvoluntarist's argument doesn't prove y is false ; it simply proves that y is true because : if x then y is not a valid argument . if mrvoluntarist had said that aaron's claim was z , that would have been a strawman . but mrvoluntarist simply showed to aaron's satisfaction that x was false . that is not a strawman ; that's simply pointing out a false premise . x is if an action is violent , then it is wrong . y is the violent act of shooting trespassers is wrong . z is the violent act of fighting in a war is wrong .

:: * further research reveals that the mexican supreme court has revised its position on life sentences , and that extradition is now possible . i have therefore deleted the section , since it is clearly out of date . ( sources : wanted fugitive raul gomez garcia extradited to the u.s. ( us embassy in mexico ) and mexico alters extradition rules ( bbc news )) . there may be merit in a future section explaining the shifting interpretations , but i suggest that this should not be given undue prominence , and should be carefully checked against the nuances of what appears to be subtly shifting jurisprudence . in the meantime , i have added a paragraph to the article on life imprisonment briefly explaining the history of the dispute , and linked to it from brief note on article 18 under the new heading other articles . i hope that this accommodates all viewpoints .
