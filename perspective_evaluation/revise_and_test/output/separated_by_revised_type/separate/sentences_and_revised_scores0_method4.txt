- this is not creative . those are the dictionary definitions of the terms insurance and ensurance as properly applied to destruction . if you don't understand that , fine , legitimate criticism , i'll write up three man cell and bounty hunter and then it will be easy to understand why ensured and insured are different - and why both differ from assured . the sentence you quote is absolutely neutral . you just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back ( e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare ) guiding the insurance , nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the ira from being broken by the british . if that's my fault , fine , i can fix that to explain . but ther'es nothing personal or creative about it . i'm tired of arguing with you . re : the other article , multi-party turns up plenty , and there is more use of mutually than mutual . if i were to apply your standard i'd be moving mutual assured destruction to talk for not appealing to a reagan voter's biases about its effectiveness , and for dropping the ly . there is a double standard in your edits . if it comes from some us history book , like peace movement or ' m . a . d . ' as defined in 1950 , you like it , even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest . if it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms , you consider it somehow non-neutral ... gandhi thinks eye for an eye describes riots , death penalty , and war all at once , but you don't . what do you know that gandhi doesn't ? guess what : reality is not neutral . current use of terms is slightly more controversial . neutrality requires negotiation , and some willingness to learn . this is your problem not mine . you may dislike the writing , fine , that can be fixed . but disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases , or failing to make critical distinctions like ' insurance ' versus ' assurance ' versus ' ensurance ' ( which are made in one quote by an air force general in an in-context quote ) , is just a disservice to the reader . if someone comes here to research a topic like mad , they want some context , beyond history . if this is a history book , fine , it's a history book . but that wasn't what it was claimed to be ...

i'm not sure if it's properly called fifth tuning or perfect fifth tuning or what , but it does exist . the octave is slightly sharper than twice the frequency , but according to the book it sounds better that way because the first overtone of a piano is itself sharp . i don't have a piano , so i've never tried it ; besides , the second overtone is even sharper than the first ( stiff strings do that ) . -

no , it is not the same as the fischer clock . the bronstein clock would already get closer , as in byo-yomi like in bronstein but unlike fischer one cannot ' save up ' time for the next move . however , byo-yomi differs from both systems because the extra time is only received when the normal playing time has already been lost , whereas the fischer and bronstein systems do it from the first move on .

well , i am not trying to pick a fight ) but i have npov issues with this article . it reads at the moment like a celebration of scientific progress . i have two problems : first , it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in , to science as a specifically western project . second , although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge , the history of science is rather more complicated than that . one way to deal with this ( if others find my criticisms valid ) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge ( from aristotle to bacon to comte to popper ; from aristotle to darwin to mendel to mayr ; from aristotle to newton to einstein and planck ; etc , on the one hand , and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science ( i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science ) , on the other . for example , i think everyone agrees that aristotle , newton , einstein and planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world but i think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims . i'd hope a good article on the history of science would inform me of these issues , and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another . i am no expert on this but i really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of , say , thomas kuhn and bruno latour , could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously , as well as the claims of those with opposing views . i am glad ed has begun this article , it can be really important and it is a needed contribution . sr

actually , yes , that's what i'm saying . the protection should only have a time out function to resolve pending edits on the talk page . if the current revision is the cause of the problem , you should first revert to a previous one before protecting the page , but no more than that . that you find this funny indicates that you seriously overestimate the range of sysop responsibilities .

erik , for crying out loud . you legally can have sex with children , but not with underage children . underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent ( different states have 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 or 18 as the underage limit . children in most countries means someone under the age of 18 . in ireland for example , a ' child ' aged 17 is over the age of consent . in britain it is 16 . do you know the first thing about the topic ? the name is standard english asage . scandal is a pov term . allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court , which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid . roman catholic church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the roman catholic church . public relations is minor tabloid point when you are discussing the rape of children , so stop adding in an irrelevant topic . your mucking around lost a lot of changes , spelling corrections and other problems solved . i was caught in an edit conflict with you and given the scale of the changes could do nothing but a cut and paste job . i then tried to go in to your version to transfer over accurate changes but then you started this insane fucking around with the article's location , using a pov title . i will keep moving back to a carefully worded neutral title .
