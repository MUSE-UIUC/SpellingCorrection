revert again -yes , lgagnon is well-known throughout the wiki community for her widespread use of verbal abuse , is getting quite the record for vandalism and has in fact been blocked on numerous occasions . she also deletes any criticism from her talk page rather that leaving what was written alone . clearly she cannot handle constructive criticism ; is anger management required here ? she seems to believe that because she has a community college writing diploma she is superior to others and is not required to treat others in a civilised manner . for shame , for shame .
