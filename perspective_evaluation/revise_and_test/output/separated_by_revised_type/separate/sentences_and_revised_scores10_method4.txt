= = semantic split = = ok , i edited the article to clearly differentiate between the two meanings . what i was thinking was that the in economics part should move to poverty line , since in this sense , being in absolute poverty means nothing more than being below someone's poverty line . the material left over fot the section on how the phrase is used to mean extreme poverty is barely more than a dictionary definition , and so should either be moved to wiktionary , merged with poverty , or both .

: afaik they were not granted full independence - from some declassified state department memos i was looking at , when eric williams tried to force the us to withdraw from its bases in trinidad the british government re-assured the us that if williams became too extreme in his demands they ( the uk ) could remove him from power . since this was during the federation ( 1960 , if i remember correctly ) i would infer that the federation was not independent . other than that i just have negative proof - that i have never heard of an independence ceremony ( which , if it had happened would have been in trinidad , since the federal capital was there ) and the fact that most of the islands reverted to being british possessions after dissolution .

: actually , i am pretty sure for example maris verpakovskis real name is like that , because maris is even latvian name . at least here in lithuanian there are both russians who uses their names as they'd use in russia and who uses lituanised versions ( with endings as or is ) . out of russians who uses lituanised names , many are second or third generation ; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases , it happens especially in mixed families . e.g. one of lithuanian football team players is igoris morinas ; it would be wrong to change it to igor morin because igoris morinas is his real name . while , for example , real name of the mentioned poolitician is viktor uspaskich , not viktoras uspaskichas , therefore viktor uspaskich is and should be used ( and is used that way in lithuanian wikipedia too ) . as for latvian football team , i am not really sure though , but i am sure that for example verpakovskis is not mariy verpakovskiy or something . maybe someone could shed more light on latvian policy on names , maybe in latvia it is different than here in lithuania , or maybe latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship ? i don't know here .

:: wikipediawide convention for political parties is to always translate names into english , unless they are commonly known to english-speakers only by a non-english name . bilingual party names are common enough ... for example in canada one can find an organization officially known as the liberal party of canada/parti libéral du canada but its listed on the english wikipedia as simply the liberal party of canada . likewise , the organization officially called the labour party/páirti an lucht oibre , gets filed as just labour party . so while fianna fáil and fine gael do indeed get listed by their irish names , that makes them an exception rather than the rule . amongst english speakers in ireland the party this article refers to is always calledin common usage , anyway the green party , never green party/comhaontas glas , despite what the party constitution might say . -
