: admin bishonen , thank you for bringing this up on the noticeboard . i can appreciate the work involved in gathering the diffs that you did , though i would draw particular emphasis to my concerns that you are not neutral in this matter as i explained . : i do look forward to further comment , particularly as to whether i should file an rfc or rfar ( i am still fuzzy on the difference between them , as i have never been involved with one ) . my best attempt at summarizing the dispute can be seen , with further evidence available as needed . thanks .

: you left me a note a couple days ago about whether i thought abp . burk would be named a cardinal . . . i don't really know , but i doubt it . st. louis is one of those diocese ( baltimore is the other that comes to mind ) that sometimes has a cardinal , but not always . we have not had one as abp . since cardinal carberry retired in the early 1980's ( he died in about 1998 ) . i think as the church becomes less a european and north american church we will see fewer cardinals from small and mid-sized diocese like stl and more from africa , asia , and south america . i also think the controversies over things like st. stans make it less likely thatburke would get picked for a red hat .

:: it seems to me that in open source model , open source is a compound modifier of model ( some would hyphenate open-source to be clear ) . searching for source model seems to always find it preceded by an adjective ( open ) , participle ( closed ) , or noun community compounding with source . one instance where source model is clearly atomic is here , where source model is used to mean gcc's internal model of the source code . maybe what we're really talking about is license for use of object code and license for use of source code . regards , —
