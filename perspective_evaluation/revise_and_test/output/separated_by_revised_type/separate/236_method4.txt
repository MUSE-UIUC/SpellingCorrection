the article stinks ; i have said so . it has been written from an extreme and disputable point of view , from two sources which share it , on a subject on which there are innumerable sources of other points of view ; it contains statements which can only be explained as partisanship or ignorance . that is not uncivil ; it is a defense - and the only defense - against wikipedia being publicly embarassed . it would be regrettable if your involvement in the same wikiproject , or the same nationality , were to create a cabal to defend bad work .
