: sure , there aren't many such actions for general u , but given an action one can choose an invariant u , i do not see a problem here . if you want to change def . to more stadard (?) it is fine , but i like this one ... if you change to diffeomorphsm it will give the same orbifold , but the def will become mor complecated . i do not know a good ref . i'm not sure but it seems that thurston was mostly interested in 3-d case . i took a def from some paper ( now i do not remember which ) and modifyed it a bit
