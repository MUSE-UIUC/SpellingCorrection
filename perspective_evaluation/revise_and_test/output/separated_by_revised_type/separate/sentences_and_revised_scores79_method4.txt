: lysy , i did not accuse you in anything . i simply pointed out to the existence of the trend with catherine , suvorov , russo-japanese war and even tyutchev , pushkin and ded moroz articles getting an excessive polonocentric view . i disagreed with that particular edit to the ra article because it is within that pattern , set not by you . the reason why that illustration was not optimal , is explained in detail at talk : russian architecture#stalin's palace in warsaw . your attempt to illustrate the article was appreciated . the image later was replaced with the image that illustrated the article better and there is no need for more than one illustration of this particular issue in such a broad article , especially since we have several narrower ones .

let me narrow the discussion down to one of the more widely-known nahuatl names : nezahualcoyotl . in spanish , this is usually but not always written : nezahualcóyotl . the nahuatl wikipedia does have an entry for him : nah : nezāhualcōyotl ( with horizontal accents over the vowels ) . however , there seem to be very few english google entries which use accent marks . the encyclopedia britannica article has no accents , fr'instance . i would suggest that we should either use the two vertical accents ( as per nahuatl wikipedia ) or none at all . i completely dislike the idea of following the spanish example since nezahualcoyotl was not spanish in any way and this is not a spanish language dictionary .
