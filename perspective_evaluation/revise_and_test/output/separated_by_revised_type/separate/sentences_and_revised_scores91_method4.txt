= = toward a better description of the collapse of the sla = = there is lots of detail missing in the account of the collapse of the sla . the idf , according to its plan of withdrawal , started handing major positions in lebanon over to the sla in the middle of may 2000 . the collapse started on may 22 , 2000 . around a dozen villages and eight sla posts in the center of the front surrendered to hezbollah . the posts were mostly manned by shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by hezbollah . hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the sla in april 2000 . the threats were most effective against the shites in the sla . antoine lahad , the leader of the sla was in paris while all of this was going on . lahad's departure for france at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the sla . lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the july departure of the idf . he claims to not have been aware of the handover of idf positions to the sla in may . by the end of the day , the sla front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the sla positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack . on the morning of may 23 , 2000 , the western ( druze ) sector of the front collapsed . there were ( in 2000 ) reports of a secret deal between walid jumblatt and hezbollah that led to the collapse . this triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the sla . shortly after , both israelis and some elements of the sla were moving south . the retreat was finished by the early hours of may 24 . israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the sla . the controversy in all this is what the israelis really intended to do in may . many senior figures in the sla claim that israel announced the july departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from lebanon in may 2000 . these sla people claim that israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the lebanese could not be trusted with the information . i dont tend to believe these sorts of stories . my view is that the sla collapsed out of its own internal weakness . the sla was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of . hezbollah worked on breaking off the shite and druze elements of the sla . the shite portion cut a deal first . the druze portion , seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after . lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away . i think most of what i've wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time ( may 2000 ) . i've put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial . maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the sla collapse .
