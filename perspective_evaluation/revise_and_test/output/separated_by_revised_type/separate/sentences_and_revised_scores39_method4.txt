in response to the genetics of kurds and jews = = i would like to point something out . there are genetic similarities between certain jewish groups and iranian peoples that is because those people are iranian jews , either tats , or persian jews or kurdish jews . jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group . there are negroid jews from africa and dravidian jews from southern india . one of the largest populations to have jews is that of the iranian peoples . in fact the state of iran has the second largest jewish population in the middle east after israel . the similarity of these people , jews and kurds in particular is due to shared iranian genes among a few other minor ones . there is an article about kurdish jews and persian jews . it is called the children of queen ester . ester was the empress of queen of iran and wife of emperor xerxes who fought the athenians and spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the persian wars . a large portion of israelis are iranian jews like israel's head of state , moshe katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from yazd , iran and the current israeli defence minister . the genetic similarities that are greatest between kurds and jews are with the group of jews that are iranian or also what is termed ' iranic ' origin such as persian jews and kurdish jews or tats . one will find that jews that are from arabic countries are very similar to arabs and that jews from europe are very similar genetically to the europeans . mind you there is in most jews a hint or trace of that unique hebrew gene of their semitic ancestors , but it is not the dominant genetic make up . the genes of the nations the jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup . a russian jew is ethnically a russian while an iranian jew is ethnically an iranian . european jews are in fact not semitic , as opposed to arab jews who are semitic . semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people , while many european jews are fair and resemble the native european population . i hope you follow . genetically and hereditarily the closes people to the kurds are the lur and bakhtari , which are both iranian peoples , followed by the persians . the article that is basically claiming that kurds are closer to jewish populations than iranians is incoherent and should be deleted because it is taken out of context and is from a non-primary and constricted source that has been widely disagreed with by the scientific community . = =
