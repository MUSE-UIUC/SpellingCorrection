i don't think that unborn child is a misleading term . there's no need for the terms emotive and scientific . just the word term should suffice . let the readers decide which side is correct . using those words violates npov . it clearly shows favoritism for the anti-life side . i'm clearly correct . there's no reason for an editing war on this . just agree with me .

i have followed the ban closely ; i don’t think this statement “ the ccp has ruthlessly suppressed the flg , using murder and torture ” is not based on facts . yes torture and death of practitioners did happened , but there is no government policy to torture and murder . i believe these were acts committed by individual brutal prison guards . but the government can be condemned for not holding investigation into the deaths and punish the perpetrators .

i understand that duncan sometimes look at the refs in disbelief but you have got to put yourself in his position and think how he must feel when going down the clutch . he gets stepped on by nowitzki which causes nowitzki to twist his ankle and get tim fouled out from a very important game . or how frustrating it must be to pass the ball to something else on your team and a jump ball be called . it is just unbelievable . it's like saying jason terry did not punch finley . and you do agree that avery did try to waste his fouls on tim duncan so why is it that you say that every play down the defensive end mavs get called for a foul ? if you agree with the stragedy avery is trying to put out ? because you did say this he obviously didnt act like it , because that strategy is only smart if you're using second and third string players to do the fouling and if you look at the stats you will see that his second and third string players were in foul trouble or fouled out and so were his first string . avery had dampier on duncan as 1st and 2nd string , diop 1st and 2nd string , and kieth van horn 3rd string all on tim duncan . so what is not understandable here ?? look at the stats to see if they did not play that stragedy or waste his fouls . 4 fouls in 4 minutes by kieth van horn . make sense ?? -

my understanding is that pascal was a much better producer than he was a director . i'm pretty sure i read that it was shaw who urged him to direct also after pygmalion , feeling pascal ought to have total control . but pascal's style of directing appears to be to work with actors and editors in making directing decisions for instance getting director anthony asquith and actor leslie howard to direct pygmalion , and working with editor david lean and actor/director harold french to assist on major barbara . i don't think this style was a secret . the directing talent behind pygmalion was decidedly anthony asquith , who went on to direct another shaw play the doctor's dilemma in 1958 , another success , showing it was his magic that turned shaw's plays into cinema more than pascal . pascal's success was to gain the trust of shaw and get him to grant concetions on the script . it was probably a mistake for him to direct caesar and cleopatra alone , most likely at shaw's urging , as he didn't really have the director's skill so much as the art of the deal . but he was so afraid of losing shaw that he most likely agreed to take total control to please shaw . sadly , had he kept asquith , all his later attempts might have succeeded . far from the megalomania that he is sometimes portrayed as , pascal appears to have enjoyed deep collaboration , both with the playright , the directors , and the actors . shaw came to think of pascal as such a genius that he probably pushed him too far .
