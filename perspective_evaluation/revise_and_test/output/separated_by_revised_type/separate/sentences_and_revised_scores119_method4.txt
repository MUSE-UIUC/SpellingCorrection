killing includes all killing , such as the execution of a criminal convicted of a capital offense , and the killing of an enemy soldier by a person fight a defensive war . both are not considered to be murder either in the bible , or in modern society . i'd explain this further , but honestly , i went through this in much greater detail in an online forum , and i'm really just not up to doing it . it just leads to an absurd fight that could be resolved with a dictionary but for some reason rarely is .

:: i don't disagree with your point , except that i'm not exactly trying to appease here ( i guess it sounded that way though ) - i actually think both points of view have merit which is why i'd go with the anglo-australian type of construction ( and maybe drop the manx in the first sentence ) . as i said , if you had asked me before this discussion started where the bee gees were from , i would have said australia , based on how i recall them being promoted in the 60s , and i also totally see the logic of considering them english so the dual wording does make sense to me . i've looked a bit and haven't come up with anything on the web to answer that question yet - maybe you'll have more luck . :: by the way , olivia newton-john may be relevant here : she is considered australian as well , and her wiki article calls her english-born australian or words to that effect . her bio says she was born in england , moved to australia at age 5 and moved back to england at 16 where she began recording - a pretty similar story to the beegees , and she's listed as australian which might be how she self-identifies , i don't know . but on a quick read it appears she only lived there for about 10 years , like them . :: as for whether this editing is personal , i have no idea and don't want to get into it . i do know that i am trying to reach consensus among different points of view , on this exceedingly minor point - and as i have said , there was some fussing about it a couple of months ago and it settled down with the awkward wording , because it is accurate . so i hope we can drop this quickly and move on to something more substantive .

hi jason , you have some interesting ideas on uc2 , and i'd be interested to see you develop them further , outside the constraints of wikipedia . one idea you might want to consider is a blog . this is what i've done with the concept of asymmetric design , which has been published in a couple of papers but has not yet been widely taken up . my coauthor and i have put up a blog where we can provide further explanation and illustration of the ideas , and also report some of the practical experiences in using them in real situations .
