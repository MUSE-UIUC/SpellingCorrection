dab , when i say not debatable , i mean we ( as you and i ) can't decide if hezbollah is a terrorist organization or not . we don't decide which facts to report . we need to report all the facts . we must state which countries deem it a terrorist organization . we should not be witholding certain information because we have certain bias and opinions .

( or atleast keep it on wikipedia)would you add that link on that newspage on wikipedia as a related project ? i mean it's just a archive of the site . why does it need a whole bunch of text and not just a link saying arvhive of /po/ not that that would be anything valuable to add but just as an example .
