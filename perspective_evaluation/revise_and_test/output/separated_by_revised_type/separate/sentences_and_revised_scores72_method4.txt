= = hypocrisy on wikipedia ? = = lately i've been busy on the jesse jackson article on wikipedia trying to put in a ridiculous quote of his into the article , yet i've been repeatedly told that that violates npov , even though the quote is cited . yet from reading this article on savage , i see that the liberals have had a field day in printing negative stuff about savage . a few weeks ago when i tried to take some of the stuff out , i was told , tough . if it's cited , there's nothing that you can do about it . i think that all of you guys who put negative stuff into this article should be helping me get that particular quote into the jesse jackson article , or can only negative stuff about conservatives be written on wikipedia ?
