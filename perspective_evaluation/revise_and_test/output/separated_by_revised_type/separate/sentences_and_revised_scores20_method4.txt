i think that the reputation of the marine corps has more to do with its actual historical performance on the battlefield , rather than considerations such as the selectivity of its recruitment or basic training , something that probably would distinguish it in the european perspective that you cite . another consideration is the scope , size and responsibility of the corps . the marine corps is not and has never been organized across its entire organization as a special-operations-type organization , such as the seals , special forces , or , if you will , royal marines or sas . the article points out that the corps is larger than the british army in its entirety . what the marine corps has done for most of its history , and what has distinguished it largely from the us army , is serve as a mobile and convenient expeditionary force , in coordination with the navy , in a large number of small actions in support of us policy , most of them in the western hemisphere or in asia . ( the us didn't even maintain a large standing peacetime army until after 1945 ) . outside those years when a major war was being fought ( technically , the us congress has declared war only five times in history ) , if someone saw an armed american in their country , that person was likely to be a marine . i would argue that the most relevant perspective on the reputation of the marine corps would be the perspectives and memories of its historical enemies . i would invite anyone interested , and will work myself , to find and document in this article reliable quotes and sources of those who have encountered marines in battle . 10:29 30 august 2005 ( utc )

we do agree that speculations about geli are unhelpful for the article , although mentioning her suicide is imo encyclopedic . however , mentioning wholly unsupported stuff about fetishes and retirements to antarctica is not encylopedic , since including all the nutty things ever said about mr hitler would fill several books and be way detached from reality .
