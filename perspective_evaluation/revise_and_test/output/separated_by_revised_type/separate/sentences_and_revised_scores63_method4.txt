i changed this page to bjørli to reflect local spelling ( which of course is immensely variable ) . there's no problem with changing it back , but the majority of residents ( as far as i am aware ) spell it with an Ø , not an o : welcome . obviously you're familiar with the area , if not a native . which makes sense , since most changes go in the opposite direction ( i.e. , anglicize the word ) . pleased to see you here on wikipedia . : propose to stick with the norwegian naming convention ( esp . since it corresponds to the lesja municipality web site ) . but will revise the article to show the alternative spelling as well . : are you still living in the lesja area ? if so , any chance you have photos or other local material ? this is a thin group of articles for a magnificant area . : tusen takk -

::: you are equating two different things . it makes little more sense to say incest is torture ( in the usual sense of the word torture ) than it does to say incest is murder . that could also be justified in some sense , but it would be misleading given that the main sense of murder is nothing to do with the first mentioned sin .

hi math . thanks for the page with the pictures of her art . i find it very interesting . her pictures of women's bodies as commodities are very disturbing , while her photos of morrissey are beautiful . i really want to get my hands on the morrissey shot book , but i couldn't order it from amazon , apparently they can't ship it to my country . anyway , i know what you're talking about , information on linder and ludus is very hard to find . besides the ludus biography you quoted , i've come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in 2000 : the guardian article http://film.guardian.co.uk/feature_story/feature_story/0,,138286,00.html and here is a long and in-depth article : http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/nov2001/manchester_voodoo.html her real name is linda mulvey . the guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth ( 1954 , liverpool ) and a bit on her background . i have some pictures from ludus sleeves that i might include in the article . besides the importance of being morrissey , linder also appeared in southbank show on the smiths . what other magazine articles have you found about her ? she's usually mentioned in connection with morrissey , and even that is very rarely . the only magazine article i can think of is that ( in)famous nick kent the face 1985 article on the smiths . there are also a few pages about her in the severed alliance , but it's similar stuff as in that ludus biography you posted the link to , plus some interesting quotes by richard boon and trotter . apparently her flat in whalley range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists . they also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle , that pete shelley wrote buzzcocks ' ' what do i get ' as a plea of unrequited love for her , and that she inspired a lot of devoto's early work . her name also pops up a lot in songs that saved your life - besides cemetry gates , she's mentioned in entries for miserable lie , wonderful woman , last night i dreamt that somebody loved me ( in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single ) and i won't share you . in the latter , there's another quote from the unused morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled crepuscule ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar : oh linder . oh linder . i'll see you sometime , somewhere . however , i'm not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article , for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters ... then again , it's not like wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours ( morrissey page is one of the examples ! ) but it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work ... so i don't know .
