= = northrop grumman = = hello sarah ! i've edited the controversy section you added to northrop grumman a bit . first of all , i think it was a great addition , that really helped improve the article - a company like northrop grumman should definitely have a controversy section . but i thought the critisism was a little bit too heavy in places , and some pov shone through . so i edited it , hopefully making it somewhat more neutral . please take a look .
