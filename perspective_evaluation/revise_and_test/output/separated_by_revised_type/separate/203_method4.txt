i know , i have watched this senor vergara asshole single handedly destroy this list over and over again . this was never discussed and i don't know were you think you can just add all this useless crap . and thats exactly what it is - useless carp , it is not needed and should not be added . if you are having trouble understanding the interim title then you are probably the dumbest person on the face of the earth . and you don't have to put who they beat for the title every single time , thats just idiotic . -removing your info/crap is a good idea , and im glad someone did it . -your contributing is what should require some discussion . -who are these people having trouble reading the list ?, besides your dumbass ? -you in no way clarified the situation .
