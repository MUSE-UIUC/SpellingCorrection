agreed re shost . i looked at the jsb article , btw , and i look forward to its being promoted to fac . i had a few suggestions , which i will be happy to repeat on the fac page . notably , the keyboard works section is a bit slight , especially considering that this was the principal source of jsb's reputation until the great mass was revived by mendelssohn . i am wondering if some attention to the 24 ( a must really , given its influence ) , english and french suites and/or works such as the italian concerto might not be better representative of jsb's keyboard writing & influence ? please let me know if you need any help . cheers ,

bullying ? would threatening to commit a crime against the author constitute bullying ? as i've pointed out numerous times , zarove threatened to publish acharyas credit information online if i didn't back off . procuring someones credit report under false pretenses is a crime . furthermore , this suggests zarove has acharyas ssn . the mentally ill person who kidnapped her child is known to have passed acharyas personal information , such as her ssn , to fringe religious groups like tektonics.org . he is wanted by the authorities . zarove , have you been in touch with this psychotic kidnapper ?
