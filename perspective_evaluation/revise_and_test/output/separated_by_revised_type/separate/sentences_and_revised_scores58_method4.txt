i'm inclined to disagree with the advice given on the grounds that , regardless of ' experience of editing wikipedia , ' the fact is that i am repeatedly being blocked by callow , right-wing youths who happen to have got to the administrator position first . it definitely seems wrong to put specialist experience above experience of life , in this instance . hopw do i ' self-nom , ' anyway ?

as the article stands ( this second ) i can't bring myself to edit it any further . but its still pushing one way , pretending the evidence is out there that the 38 million year ice age is over ( praise be ) . well that would be great news if true but the level of certainty sometimes expressed in this direction is quite inappropriate . i would like to see the reasoning behind this with all workings shown . here is a few scientists you might check for balance : sallie l . baliunas , robert c . balling jr , randall s . cerveny , john cristy , robert e . davis , oliver w . frauenfeld , ross mckitrick , patrick j michaels , eric s posmentier , willie soon .

i reverted the changes to the list because they seemed to be pruning out the genuinely notable films , while leaving many that aren't . i've heard of almost all of the films that were removed , but only a few that were kept . i ( prematurely ) assumed somewhat poor faith and reverted the change . i think that we should discuss which films should be kept . certainly star wars is notable . i think that such removals should be considered more carefully . is there any particular reason why the current list was kept ?

: having been born in belfast , and having lived in bangor , northern ireland for many years , i counted the number of towns in north america with these names . this was a few years ago now , but i seem to remember there having been something like 13 towns in the usa called bangor , and about 6 towns called belfast . with the large number of scots-irish and irish-americans in the usa , would it be surprising if this town wasn't named after the town of bangor located in northern ireland ? the only tune i can think of that mentions bangor refers to the town in wales . either way , perhaps one of these towns deserves mention in the article .
