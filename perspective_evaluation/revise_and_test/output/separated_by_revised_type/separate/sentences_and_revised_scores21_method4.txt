ang again , i have no problem with the npov policy it is merely that the minority view should not be stifled in a minority view article . here is the policy again : none of this , however , is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views . there is no size limit to wikipedia . but even on such pages , though a view is spelled out possibly in great detail , we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth .
