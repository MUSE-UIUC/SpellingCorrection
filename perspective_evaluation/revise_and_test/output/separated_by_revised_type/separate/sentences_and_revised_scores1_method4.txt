i've hidden the description of how to pronounce the sound . my reason for doing so is most of all that the character is used in several languages , and i believe it's wrong to assume that the pronounciation is similar in all non-english languages ( also when it is similar in some ) . i'm also convinced that an article designated for vowel-sounds would be a better place . a link to such an article would surely be the best . -) i do also feel awkward about the notes on being an umlaut and on alphabetization , which i actually feel would fit much better in the articles on the different alphabets .

the point is not how plenty of people talk ; i'm sure plenty of people talk plenty good . the point is now large an area the debris field covers . a statement to the effect that the debris covers a 60-by-60 foot area is incredible regardless of how colloquially it is expressed .

calling the only conservatives response partisan is not neutral . both parties see the other as partisan , and themselves as acting in the national interest . furthermore , the conservatives have made their exact reservations about loss of sovereignty quite clear . don't use phrasing that implies the contrary . ' the influence of the right-wing and american-friendly press ' makes it sound like all the press meet that description , but their are not many who consider the guardian to be either . also , do papers dictate their readers opinions , or copy them ? since that's highly debatable , don't assume a position . ' fear of loss of sovereignty — a fear not apparently present on the continent ' scare quotes are partisan , and there are polls showing 40-50% opposition in france , which is on the continent . shorter paragraphs are more readable on screen .
