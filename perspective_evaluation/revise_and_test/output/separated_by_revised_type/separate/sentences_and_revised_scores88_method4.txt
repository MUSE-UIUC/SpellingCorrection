the entire article though very exhaustive and informative is a bit biased . one important point this the article fails to mention ( either deliberately or due to lack of knowledge ) is that hindus are also opposed to the ucc . this is because once the ucc comes into force the tax benifits accuring due to the huf ( hindu undived family ) in the income tax acts will become untennabe constitutionaly . another thing about the subsidies given to muslims for haj , there are some hindu equivalents . for instance hindu pilgrims to amarnath get subsidies amounting to rs 5000 .
