= = withdrawn charges = = the london free press also reported that his charges were withdrawn silently . now from the perspective of a normal criminal process , this usually means the police had a weak case . the fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all ( judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case ) . in other words , homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage james scott richardson . what is my point of reference ? well . when i added information to alex kulbashian and richard warman about a canadian human rights commission complaint file by alex against richard , homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed , however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the commissioner signed off on it . now , getting back to this case , the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction . to homeontherange : if you are going to have double standards in enforcing wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles , then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your administrative tasks . that would be classified as administrator abuse wikipedia : administrators #administrator_abuse . furthermore , the fact that the ip address 72.136.34.96 spontaneously lost the ability to make edits without logging in with no explanation could also show a certain level of abuse of administrative rights ( by the way . will be reporting that to jimbo wales ) . so feel free to revert the edit i've made , but make an attempt to justify your actions this time .
