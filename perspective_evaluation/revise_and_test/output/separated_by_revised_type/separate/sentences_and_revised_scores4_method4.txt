* that's an interesting thought . it is useful to note , though , that post-1961 discourse among unitarian universalists tends to conflate the three categories . a good example of this is the famous uus t-shirt that my sister has . if no one wants to do the work of disaggregating these lists , perhaps we could just add an explanation saying that the list includes unitarians , universalists , and unitarian universalists .
