: i agree , if nobody has anything more to write about it , the article should be merged back in to 2005 atlantic hurricane season . the reason has nothing to do with notability ( alpha wasn't in any way notable , but that's not the point ) . the reason is that this article should not exist if that article already has the exact same thing as a summary . only if the summary is shorter than the full text should the article exist . however there's no need for an edit war here . since the storm is no longer active , making this decision isn't time-sensitive . my suggestion is to add to the article and give people a few weeks to write about it .

for instance , in the later part of the article , some numbers are given , such as the 500,000 palestinians residing in saudi arabia . but then in the section under lebanon , there are no numbers . if this information is elsewhere , then can a wikilink be placed somewhere ?

keep in mind with josé and alpha that only one storm name has been retired without the storm reaching hurricane strength , tropical storm allison in 2001 . it caused over 50 deaths in the houston area . although i am sure , jeanne would have joined allison had it not reach hurricane strenght due to what it did as a tropical storm . i also highly doubt ophelia will be retired and am not so sure that it merits its own article . but , these are things we can take care of in the off-season ( if there is one ) and we have more time for cleanup .

i agree with your ideas about comprehensible articles on physics . i was a physics major in a major university for a couple years , eventually broadened out to other things , but i can still read pauli and reichenbach without feeling that i got caught in the spin cycle of a rug washer . the same isn't true of the wikipedia physics articles . i've tried to clear up the philosophy of qm article that is under rfd , but mr. ingham has not answered my questions about what he is trying to say in a responsive way . the simplified article looks like a better place to start . my experience in physics at the university level may be relevant . we had a trimester system . the first trimester was mechanics . i did o.k. , but calculus was new to me . the second semester was electricity . since i had shocked myself working on old radios , made crystal radios , etc ., etc . for years , i already knew what was going on . in some ways i was ahead of our grad student lab leader , who couldn't understand why putting one probe of a volt meter into the dc outlet on the lab bench did not produce a reading . my grade jumped to a , not because i was any smarter , but because i knew from experience what happens when resistors are wired in series and when they are wired in parallel , and to other students such matters were totally abstract . i think that students should begin with real-world experiences as much as possible . unfortunately , many students live in very restricted environments . if you live in a high-rise apartment building you might not realize you could just trail the antenna for a crystal radio out the window . it would be nice if you would put something on your user page indicating background , interests , etc .
