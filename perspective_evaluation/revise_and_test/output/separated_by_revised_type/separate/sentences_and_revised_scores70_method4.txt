no , it should not be included . what the section ammounts to is some nut claimed that mccarthy was gay but didn't have any evidence . in fact , the nut himself turned out to be in the closet . interesting note that the same people that are fighting to slander mccarthy with this gay thing are the ones that think homosexuality is normal . if it's normal then why bring it up ? this whole section is rediculous , i think we need a section on mccarthy being a space alien next . mccarthy's sins against the left will never be forgiven and they will go to any ends to slander him .

fair enough . i'm in the process right now of properly linking the sourced text inside the article . the links are fair and balanced as some are from right-leaning websites , some are from left-leaning websites , and some are from completely independent websites . they all pretty much state the same thing .

= = rasmussen reports in controversies and allegations of bias = = a poll conducted by rasmussen reports during october , 2004 found that the public perceived fox news as the second most politically biased news network , with 34% respondents saying they believed that fox's goal was to help elect bush , leaving fox second only to cbs , which was perceived by 37% as being biased in the wake of the memogate scandal . [ 1 ] so basically this is saying fnc is not the most biased , cbs is . im pretty sure this section may as well be removed . the whole controversies and allegations of bias section is a mess really . put it all on its own page , this bit only needs to be a brief summary of complaints
