: exactly . as i noted , it's a poor translation . but it's good enough to show that the article does not claim , as you stated that it did , that levy is a rabid anti-zionist , that he is a spokesman for fatah , or that his translators are affiliated to fatah . you simple invented this , presumably in the hope that most readers would be unable themselves to check the original . which is why i posted a link to this poor translation ( by someone who agrees with linur ) , so that people could judge who was telling the truth about its content .

= = first edition preferred = = hi . i was amused to see this added to the infobox on the small rain , published in 1945 . having collected l'engle novels for over 30 years , i've still never even seen the original cover of this book - and if i did , i'd have to think long and hard before spending several hundred dollars to buy it and scan it for wikipedia . rest assured that i will always post first edition covers if i have them , but it's not always possible . for example , my hardback of the young unicorns is an ex-library rebinding . i've searched online for the cover of the first edition , and nobody has one posted . all i see is lots and lots of copies of the current paperback cover art . no big deal at this end - i know you're just adding standardised info on what we want to post whenever possible . still , i'll be very surprised if we ever get 100% compliance on l'engle books of the 1940s to 1960s . regards , and keep up the good work ! | |
