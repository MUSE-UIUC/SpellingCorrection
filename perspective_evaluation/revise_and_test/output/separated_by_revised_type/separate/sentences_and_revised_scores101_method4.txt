( from personal interviews by the author ) . for his part , wallis was ( and still is ) an exceptional lead guitarist very much in the virtuoso mould , but with far too much energy to fall into the fretboard-bore category .

the fact is the page is called list of frieza related characters not frieza related groups . meaning it's about the characters not just a group . it should be listed the same way cooler's armour fighting squad is listed . it does not defeat the purpose of the ginyu force page , the ginyu force page has many other things listed other than just the bios . if this is the way you think , to shorten everything , why don't you just take away goku and vegeta page , why not just have gogeta p and i don't think i can do anything i want with these pages but sure looks like that's what you think .
