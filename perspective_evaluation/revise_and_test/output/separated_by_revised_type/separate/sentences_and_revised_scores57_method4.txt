::: i really don't care about the few google searches that result ( one of which is this site ) . if i put in chelsea or boys town ( halstead st , chicago ) tons of hits appear . not a handful . gays don't have to wear signs . but there should be more than one drinking establishment that caters to them . the one dike bar on 4th ave is usually pretty dead , as is the one on 5th ave . the point is there is no gay community . a few lesbians does not a community make . but i'm not denying that lesbians call the neighborhood home . it has been a liberal neighborhood for 30 years . the point is , the term itself , dyke slope . i don't like it . i've never heard it . i don't think its appropriate for wikipedia . and don't tell me what to do . i can type whatever i feel like on this page . i think you sound like a delusional , academic lesbian who wishes you had a neighborhood of your own . i've never even denied that lesbians are found in the neighborhood . my point is that while they have always been present , perhaps in greater numbers than elsewhere , they have had minimal impact on the neighborhood . they certainly have not been numerous enough to warrant a term like dike slope . the reality is lesbianism is largely an academic phenomenon . it doesn't surprise me in the slightest some professor would make such a claim . but , that one class does not trump a substantial portion of my personal experience over many years .

gsd2000 , i saw the comments by rjensen and graemeleggett , and if it will help , i am sorry if it appeared as though i was falsly accusing you of solely advocating the position on rockall . however , my statement was not only on rockall , but the article in general including the map and your position that we need to copy the style of academic literature . read it again and point out where i mention rockall . i simply pointed out the fallacy in your argument for excluding rockall ( which from 1955 to 1972 was a possession and not anything like a county sussex ) and that your example again indicates overall how you would wish the article written . as for rjensen's comments , maybe he should then explain the various uninhabitable rocks possessed by australia , the united kingdom , and in particular the united states ( e.g. ashmore and cartier islands , rockall , baker island , howland island , johnston atoll , navassa island and all the other united states minor outlying islands ) . empire does not only deal with people and governments it also deals with territory and the status of the territory in relation to the possessing country . guinnog , as i said before , this stuff is really not worth starting an edit war over . if gsd2000 wants the article a certain way and others support him , then they have every write to edit the article . of course , considering that they can hardly answer any questions or points we may bring up ( or maybe they just ignore them ) nor actually give definitions to what constitutes kosher imperialism , trivialities etc then we should bring this debate to some forum or bringing in an admin ( although by gsd2000's comments he ( or she ) seems to be or thinks he ( or she ) is admin ) . anon 7:05 pm , april 15 , 2006 .
