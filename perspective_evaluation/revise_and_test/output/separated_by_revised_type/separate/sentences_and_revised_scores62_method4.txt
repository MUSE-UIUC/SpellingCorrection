this is one of the things you wrote : he will not admit when asked , but off the record , his biggest mistake is creating the lethal killing machine chuck norris . is that not a personal attack on chuck norris ? if you can understand english and the structure of this sentence , it if jeffery korus ' biggest mistake , not an attack on chuck norris , more of an admittance of something done wrong by jeffery korus . it is close to saying julius caesars biggest mistake was being killed . the structure of sentences should be paid more attention to i would think before you delete someones article that does not actually violate anything close to a personal attack .

i removed the following : : although the surrounding area is in north somerset , the suburb of leigh woods is actually within the bristol city boundary . because when you cross the bridge , within about fifty yards you come to a sign saying welcome to north somerset , and because iirc , the boundary marked on ordnance survey maps follows the avon continuously . does anybody have any evidence to the contrary ?

i have only just noticed that you are changing the names from common to scientific because you are starting to do the australian snakes ( all of which i am watching ) . you do have a good argument , although i do not fully agree . the problem is that you are not going about it the wrong way . since it is policy , you should be first trying to change the policy before mass changes to the encyclopadia . the policies are there to create consistency . all you are doing now is making it more confusing . people expect to find the common names on wikipedia , because that is the way it is done at the moment . also , it seems you haven't read the tree of life guidelines properly . in it , it says that common names should be used where there are formal common names ( such as birds ) or there is a relatively unique common name . otherwise use the scientific names . for example : white's tree frog is unique , and therefore the common name should be used . however , if you look at litoria chloris , the common name cannot be used . its common name , the red-eyed tree frog has a disambigous page , explaining why that common cannot be used , and states that red-eyed tree frog is not unique . :: the entire issue is trying to account for the most ammount of people . if someone wants information on a snake , writes its common name into the search box , and comes across an article with a strange latin name , they may be off-put and think they wrote the wrong name , and it redirected to the wrong place . especially if the article did not have a photo . if a scientist wants to look at an article , and puts in the scientific name , and it is redirected to the common name , they will be aware of what the common name is . in fact , you will find that in most scientific papers , they will use the common name , stating the scientific name once in brackets so their is no ambiguity . a lot of articles use the scientific name because their is no common name . there is no other choice , and there is no problem with this . :: please , bring this up on wp : tol talk page before changing any more articles . you cannot create consistency yourself , and all you are doing is making it worse . if policy is changed other people can help , and it is possible to get all the articles changed . policy needs to be followed , otherwise the encyclopaedia becomes a jamble . thankyou .
