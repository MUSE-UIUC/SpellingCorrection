getting a professional vbulletin or invision power board would be a great idea , wikipedia is not so suited towards debates and discussions because of the fact that talk pages are well , not very organised definitely not as much as forums with easy to read different threads and forum subsections , and the fact that people can edit other peoples ' posts i think it would be a really good idea too and would encourage a lot more debate and contributions/growth to wikipedia
