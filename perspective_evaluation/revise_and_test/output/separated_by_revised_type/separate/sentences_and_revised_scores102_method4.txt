it's not a sock-puppet nor a meat-puppet nor any other kind of puppet . it is , presumably , someone else who agrees with my views . as for the peronal attacks , kb's edit summary on a recent revert of one of my edits was go away kid , you bother me . this is typical of the total lack of civility with which i am treated . i also think the points i make , resulting in kb's allegations of personal attacks , are warranted since he is claiming not to understand what the phrase state of play means in order to disrupt the talk page on telepathy , and is treating me in a condescending manner by suggesting that i am one of only three people in the universe who understands that term .
