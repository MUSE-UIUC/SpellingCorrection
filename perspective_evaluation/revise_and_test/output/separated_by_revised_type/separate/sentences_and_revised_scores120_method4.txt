you'll have to my talk page if you want to continue it . but just look at something you wrote ; the bible itself even claims hundreds of times that what it says is true . 1 . you wrote claims . claims means to assert to be true without really even being proof . the bible should not claim anything is ture . it should assure us that stuff is true . 2 . of course if i wrote something i wanted you to believe , i would tell you it's true a couple of times or here's a better idea . i'll write everything and tell you and go ' oh by the way , i'm making this all up as i'm going along .
