unfortunatly there are some people in tasmania who will use this proxy server to vandalize wikipedia . i am sure that the government find this of extreme importance , and a simple notifier of the time ( as long as the vandalism of an extreme nature ) should be reported to show who has been vandalizing this valuable page . i'm not sure the schools could handle a ban though .

interesting , so you have read this , but you refuse to respond to the accusations you know them to be highly merititious . i'm still trying to figure out the appropriate channels to figure out how to prosecute an arbitrator abuse case , but until then , i'd be very interested to hear your defense , since you've not ever attempted to make a single one beyond vague , general accusations . i think i may open a request for arbitrartion against you if necessary , but obviously that's problematic when you're dealing with arbitrarors who made the error in question .

tribe is not really a meaningful or useful word in the australian context . clan is not applicable to many australian groups either . as a linguist i prefer to talk about ' language groups ' as this is , in many cases , the highest level of group affiliation ( altho people from different language groups can have ceremonial , and other , ties ) . : someone ( ezeu ) moved yamaji to the list of tribes , but i'm going to remove it . yamaji is the word for ' man , human being ' in wajarri and is also one of the words used for that meaning in badimaya . as such it , like ngayarda in the pilbara and koori in south-east australia is used to refer to aboriginal people from a particular region ( the murchison-gascoyne region of wa ) , but may also be used to refer to aboriginal people from any part of australia . it's not a ' tribe ' in any sense that i can determine .
