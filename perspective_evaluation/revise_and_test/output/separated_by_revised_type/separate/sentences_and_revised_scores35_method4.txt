: progressive metal is progressive metal . you dont redefine names based on bands you do and do not like . also , you have just been etremely neoglistic . alternative metal is basically the forepart of nu metal , before its name changed and before the new batch of bands that got high critical acclaim . i also suggest you read the article on what nu metal is , and what alternative rock is . not all nu metal bands are out to make money , many nu metal bands have made no money , and im sure you wouldnt know any of them .

i think that some of their position statements indicate that they would . forget the specific age question . since you said above you believe some of their positions also involve heterosexual relations , shouldn't we classify nambla as a children's right org instead of a lgbt ?

for the sake of coherence , i have tried to disentangle the original exchange above from the various hostile interruptions – though readers may wish to go back a few saves to put it back together again properly . if you are responsible for them all , araliel , would you care in future to put all your thoughts together at the bottom of the piece in question , so that the rest of us can make better sense of them both – as i have usually tried to do recently ? as for the original texts that you question , these are freely available from the facsmile sites listed under external links .

* support . i don't see how the reasoning would be irrelevant . the generic correspondents of ' partido del trabajo ' is translated as ' party of labour ' into english , such is the case of the albanian party . of course parties with identical names might conduct different politics , but the case of ' party of labour ' is a special one . the name was launched inside the communist movement as an alternative to using ' communist party of x-country ' . ' labour party ' is translated ' partido laborista ' in spanish .
