:: there is no difference in rhetoric . the quote that jayjg took out of context was a citation from the qur'an that hamas uses ( also out of context ) to justify the killing of jews . zionists use similar tactics ( that's where hamas learned it ) by quoting the torah and talmud to justify the killing of non-jews . we must treat the arabs like the amalekites is a common sentiment among extremist zionists . there are quotes from zionist rabbis on this page that are indistinguishable from the logic of hamas clerics . the denial of zionism's genocidal intent and practice is similar to nazis who denied the holocaust and final solution even as they conducted it . zionists claim to be ethical and humanitarian while routinely killing hundreds of children , imprisoning thousands of adults and oppressing millions of non-jews in the name of their jewish supremacist ideology and state .

: it's so easy you could do it yourself if you weren't just interested in harassment . : some etymologists believe shyster is a derivative of shakespeare’s character shylock in the merchant of venice , used to describe a devious , scheming person of jewish background who will try any scam in the book to make a buck . in 1895 , funk’s standard dictionary defined a shyster as a lawyer who practices in an unprofessional or tricky manner ; especially one who haunts the prisons and lower courts to prey on petty criminals . in shakespeare’s play , other characters call shylock a currish jew whose desires are wolvish , bloody , starved , and ravenous ; he is accused of being the devil … in the likeness of a jew .

the idea of having an ombudsman of sorts for these pages is in fact rather attractive to me , since i work full time and it is very burdensome to attempt to respond to the hundreds of edits which slimvirgin in particular is making . however , i think the idea is problematic , because the job would require very extensive knowledge of the history of larouche and his ideas , and as snowspinner has pointed out , there are no neutral sources . additionally , for the idea to work , slimvirgin and cberlet , whose pov is every bit as partisan as mine , would necessarily also have to agree to withdraw . frankly , i was satisfied , at the conclusion of the last round of pov wars with andyl , that the larouche articles had attained npov status . it might be useful for editors to go back and look at the mid-october versions .
