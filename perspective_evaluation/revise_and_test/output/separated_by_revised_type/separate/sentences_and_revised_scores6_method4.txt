- as far as i know ancient summerian and babylonian writings conjecture that life might exist off earth and indeed that aliens may have visted our planet . seperating practical theorizing from mythologizing is of course difficult with ancient works . anyhow , this places the idea of extraterrestrial life 3000 to 4000 yrs before the present day . whether there were earlier theories i don't know . in other places where atronomy was independently invented ( india , china etc . ) its probably fair to assume that the idea of aliens must have arisen . note that the five inner planets ( excluding earth ) would all have appeared very unique to any society capable of looking at the stars systematically and would long have appeared good candidates for life .
