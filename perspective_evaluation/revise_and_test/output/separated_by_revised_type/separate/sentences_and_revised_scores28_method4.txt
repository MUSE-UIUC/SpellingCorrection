2005 ( utc ) : i essentially replaced the wording , eliminating most from most widely . jayjg reverted , but i'm going to put it in again absent a good argument against doing this . maimonides ' version clearly is widely used wikipedia's own article on the 613 mitzvot includes maimonides ' list as its only example , and describes maimonides ' work that included the list as the most important of the above works from a list of works that include versions of the list . it is also the only version that i have seen reproduced anywhere online . while jay claims that the absence of aliyah from maimonides ' list should not be mentioned because virtually every other list includes it , that is not logical if maimonides ' list is the most important of the lists ; it is essentially original research for jay to conclude that the singularity of the absence of aliyah to maimonides ' list makes it not worth mentioning . : i'm sure it is true that others of maimonides ' writings indicate what jay alleges , but the text from the article refers particularly to the 613 commandments . it would make sense ( in fact , when i replace the wording , i'll do it myself ) to note that maimonides ' other writings tend to contradict the omission , but that does not necessarily nor , i think , in fact warrant suppressing the note about the most important of the mitzvot lists being the exception to the statement in the article . : jay describes the clarification as uncited pov , which may be true regarding most widely , which i eliminated , but not widely , nor anything else about the clarification . it is also highly selective , clearly , not to note that the exception to including aliyah in the mitzvot comes from perhaps the most important of the versions . : 21:52 , 29 november
