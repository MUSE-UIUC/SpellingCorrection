hello to you . this is 195.93.21.34 , one of the family here anyway . not having contributed i thought i'd throw in my 2 cents . no one here has edited anything , and i wish to make it clear that i find many of these accusations reactionary and offensive . if any one has a problem with anything we are supposed to have written , please do us the courtesy of providing a link to the page you are talking about , so we at least can see what your accusing us of . this is the last time i will say , on behalf of this family ip , that we have not contributed to anything . any further unfounded accusations of vandalism , and any further aggressive comments containing no information at all , i will report to a member of the wikipedia team . i hope that if there are problems in the future , for example if someone else is using this ip externally , i would appreciate it if we could talk about it coherently , and once again request the courtesy of being informed of our kafka-esque crimes . thank you .

: well , first , i find it rather strange ( to put it midly ) that you agree to discuss it in the talk page ( since i asked to let's discuss it first please ) but you go ahead and do a revert anyway and call this revert campaign . that aside , i left the note for the person who had reverted the article , but you responded on his/her behalf by saying fine , let's discuss it . i find this also rather strange . finally , i don't see mentioning pilz is jewish to be controversial at all . iran's official response to this still unsubstantiated allegation has been that it is part of a zionist media smear campaign . therefore , how could you say that the fact the pilz is jewish is irrelevant ? i see it as quite relevant . i also don't see why mentioning a jewish person is jewish should be viewed as controversial even in normal course of events and contexts . really bizarre .

i just copyedited this article . in the sections that describe events fter johnny 5 changed his name from number 5 , i used his updated name . it feels awkward , though , having it say ' johnny 5 ' all over the place , as opposed to ' johnny ' or ' 5 ' , maybe . if someone else agrees with me to the point that they feel that it would be worth changing , i'm curious as to what the preferred name would be . also , i changed the ' him ' references to johnny to ' it ' , as he is a robot and not a human . if , due to the personification of the character in the movies ( i've never seen them , so i can't know for sure ... although it does seem this way from what i learned in the article ) is so complete that he _should_ be referred to by ' him ' , by all means change it . -

:: indeed numerous iranian media pointed that out right away . that is why i support the idea of including jewish at the beginning of that sub-section of the article . it is not to single out pilz because he is jewish per se , it is because both iranian media as well as officials from foreign ministry have called it a part of the on-going zionst smear campaign against iran . pilz ' early anouncements , had claimed that both final candidates of the iranian presidency were mentioned in his extraordinarily reliable agent d report . so no matter which candidate won , he would have smeared the winner . he had anticipiated that rajsanjani wins ( like most people expected ) so he had initially put the focus more on rafsanjani . as an iranian , i also feel this is coordinated . it is indeed hard to explain how the major western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins ( which so far have turned out to be false ) without even a cursory investigation . how could for example , ap , reuters and afp all three make the same mistake at the same time ? and it wasn't even on just one allegation , it was on multiple . so multiple news agencies , making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do , all at the same time ? and i have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-iran smear reports . also , you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-zionist stance . i don't think that is accidental either , they are voluntary contributors to the same smear campaign because they view islamic iran as a threat to zionism . the same people also have an interest on the rafsanjani article and probably many other iran-related articles .
