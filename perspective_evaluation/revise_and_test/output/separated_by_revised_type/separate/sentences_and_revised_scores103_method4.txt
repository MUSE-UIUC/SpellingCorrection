: there are only 2 references to the dj , one of them as disambiguation at the very top of the article . the other is in the parodies/references section , which is unnecessarily large . i highly doubt that a passing reference in the simpsons , or the fandom of characters in tv shows and novels , qualifies as notable . only a handful of references ( if that many ) belong here , and i'll be happy to pare it down soon .

seems user zero has done a good job showing that the accusations regarding bernadotte are just that , accusations , while you have not been able to come up with reliable sources . kersten is not reliable and has been shown to falsify documents , trevor-roper relied on the former - and the last two seems to have a axe to grind with bernadotte due to his position as un mediator in palestine . so i suggest you revert back , and i also suggest you remove the similar accusations from the article about the white buses .
