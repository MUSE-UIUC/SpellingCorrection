i can't find any references offhand , but they're on the back of section 1 . and i'm going absolutely crazy over it . maybe it's because i've been up for 24 hours , or maybe i've suddenly become daft , because i can't complete more than one number ( for example get all 1s placed ) . after that i'm unable to figure out where to put anything else )

ok , he seems to be referring to kosovo , but he is not referring to a preparation/pretext/argument for war . he is referring to milosevic's election . i don't believe that you can use it in an ' argument for war ' section . i feel that i am compromising too much , since the entire criticism is based on a few mentions of the word genocide . much more often the term ethnic cleansing was used , and the rest of the sentence you cut from the article , all of which is verifiable , and all those hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes , and all those little girls were raped , and all those little boys were murdered , describes ethnic cleansing perfectly . are the few uses of the word ' genocide ' indicative of the case made by the clinton administration , or were the much more frequent references to ethnic cleansing the pillar of the argument ? i would say it was certainly the latter , but because he merely uttered the term genocide , proving my point would be a book-length endeavor . i had not addressed this up until now because i have been acting under the assumption , and increasingly so , that you are writing with a partisan agenda . in the rewrite you can demonstrate your objectivity in the matter by including the big picture . we've already discussed the second paragraph to some degree . but we can rehash it if necessary .
