oh , i suppose the plus side is that if sv really is going to ignore me , i'll get the benefit of impartial comments from others when i make comments on policy talk pages . some will agree with me , some won't - but on the plus side those threads won't be drowned out with noise ,

: you're missing the point there is a theory that ashkenazi jews originated in khazaria ( not israel ) and converted to judaism only in the 8th-9th centures c.e. the western portion of khazakhstan corresponds to historical khazaria , so it's almost like sacha cohen ( half ashkenzai jew ) is poking fun at the people from the same region where ashkenazi jews are proposed to have originated from ( and to make matters even more ' funny , ' borat is anti-semitic ) . face it : if borat grew a beard and had a ny accent , he'd be jewish all the way because sacha cohen looks like a caucasianized , eastern european jew ( even though he has a sephardic mother ) .

going back even further , it is listed as global regular expression print in dale dougherty's sed & awk ( o'reilly 1990 ) . the assertion that this is a backronym is tenuous . since when would any unix user state search globally for lines matching the regular expression , and print them when global regular expression print says it all ?
