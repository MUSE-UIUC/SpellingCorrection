= = exactly .. hello ? = = just as a note not to be considered a request for any particular change .. a century ago , american progressives said they aspired to use hamiltonian means to achieve jeffersonian ends . they meant they would wield a strong federal government to promote equality . this is known as socialism . i'm a patriotic citizen , myself . i don't care much for left or right wing regimes . ( the dictators , f.d.r. or george dubya bush ) if jefferson or tom paine could see the insanity that goes on their names , by both the left and right wings of this country , they would be rolling in their graves . i read thomas jefferson's own writings and i read the writings of thomas paine . can any of you say this ? thomas paine collected writingsisbn i-883011-03-5 thomas jefferson writingsisbn 0-940450-16-x ( a 1548 page book ) . both from the library of america maggie

: my reasoning was the sidebar on the rhs of the page : this is one of 20 or more pages on bowling styles . i don't think any other bowling style page discusses a specific incident ( e.g. bodyline is not on the bouncer page ) . also , someone specifically looking up the 1981 incident is confronted with ( for them ) irrelevant stuff on the history of underarm bowling . also my observation is multi-pronged wikipedia articles tend to expand such that a split becomes necessary sooner or later - even hough , as you say , the article isn't too long yet . having said all that , if people don't agree with me then so be it .

since he has refused to justify his deletions and obtain consensus approval , i'll be reverting at will . sorry if other people's changes get wiped out in the process , but this sort of collateral damage is typical when people like tim decide to edit war to support their vandalism .

:: to clear it up , iirc , johnson is indeed the first black woman billionaire - thanks to marrying bet founder robert johnson . together , they made the empire that became bet ( but their hearts were in the right place , so i can't be too angry with them ) . oprah , on the other hand , is the first black female self-made billionaire . easy to see how they can be confused .

as i mentioned , your spurious warnings were worthless and i erased them on sight . like this block , they were an attempt to intimidate me so that i wouldn't keep correcting the gross distortions on the circumcision articles that you snippies think you own . in short , you are incapable of legitimately warning me and unqualified to block me . this is because , as i have pointed out and will gladly repeat , you act in bad faith . remember when you reverted that edit about coagulation for no other reason than to help your snippy budies win an edit war ? remember how you were unable to come up with a justification for this , even after the fact ? since that day , i have known that you are not to be trusted . your bias is a simple matter of fact . if stating facts is in violation of wp : civil and wp : npa , then it's time for that rfc to ban me for good , because i'm not ever going to stop until you make me .

why are we rehashing this tired old subject all over again ? are we going to have this argument repeatedly every time someone reads the article , and starts mechanically chanting the homosexuality has nothing to do with pedophilia mantra ? this issue was settled a long time ago , and correctly in my opinion . nambla was an essential part of the gay rights movement and is a gay organization . today's politically convenient revisionism of gay history by gays fleeing in terror from right wing talking points is irrelevant for encyclopedic purposes .
