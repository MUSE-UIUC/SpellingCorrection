: i agree . it seems that's why there are templates for other articles of this series . the inconsistencies in firefox are due to inconsistencies what browsers do with ' gray ' ( or ' grey ' ? ) instead of rgb hex values , imho . that could be solved if we set border = 0 on the tables or use hex values . problem is : if hex , which one ? i think the css article looks great in this respect , we should copy the style ( so no border ) .
