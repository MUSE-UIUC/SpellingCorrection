hi there , ok , i see what you've done here - almost a ' pseudo-link ' that refers you to a list of references at page-bottom as opposed to inserting the titles , authors , etc , in brackets in the actual sentence . could you forward me the code to use in order to have , for example , this reference linked to the bottom of the page : como llego la noche , matos , huber , tusquets-2004 thanks much - this seem to read much more easily when referencing in this manner .

: right - i'm confused . when the press describes a group as anti-semitic , should i take it to mean only anti-jewish ? i heard someone describing an incident involving an arab cab driver claiming the passengers demonstrated anti-semitic behaviour and it threw me for a loop . what are we to do ? should the article perhaps contain something that describes the current use of the term to mean ( notwithstanding the eytomolgy of ' semite ' ) only ' jewish ' ?

= = mimi gardner gates = = on the afd you voted merge into william h . gates , sr. i've added some notes to the article , namely the books she co-authored and a reference to her influence in the association of art museum director's guideline against selling art collection pieces . i think those items help establish her individual notability in the art world ( and apart from her husband and step-son ) . i would appreciate any time you may give in reviewing the additions to see if they merit a keep . thanks .

idk about that . during the 90s most bands pussed out and started selling softer albums so they could sell more . sure , every once in a while youll hear a new hard rock song from some random band on the radio , but since the early 90s hard rock has really decreased in popularity . for example , a radio station that is where im from used to only play modern hard rock , but they had so little to play they had to switch to hard rock from the past few decades . idk what bands he thinks evolved from hard rock .
