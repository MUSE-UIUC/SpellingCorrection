:: no , my edits were entirely reasonable within the context of the article . i'm sorry you felt the need to revert them , but that's really your problem . my attacks ( if you want to call them that what i asked was that you actually take the time to read & understand the edit instead of tripping the rvv hammer ) were in fact entirely impersonal , as they had nothing to do with you , only your edits . this is how adults act . deal with it .

::: well , perhaps you can point out how the famous hansen prediction , from 18 years ago now failed to predict the next ten years of observed data in your eyes , , and how the addition of more recent data futher fails to validate it . looks to me like the actual temps not only fall between his curves of estimates of max and min , but pretty close to his most likely estimate .
