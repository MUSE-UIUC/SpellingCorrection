i admit most websites are not good sources . look for members who are scientists , and not even then is it perfect . one site , not named , has tons of sightings reports , and some claimed scientists on its staff , but is run by a hoaxer who has chased off 80% of his best researchers . most of those scientists have also left . trust no one .

: i think the issue with this average human being vs . you thing is one of writing a techinical or descriptive article ( as opposed to a short story or a how too article or something similar ) is the use of the second person . it is often frowned on by the profs i had in college to put in personal pronouns into a techinical or descriptive article . it's a matter of style , i agree , but i also think that the use of personal pronouns can almost always be avoided .

: i think it is much better than it was , but as ricdod says : more work needed . for instance , the west anglia tt changes in dec 2005 did contain some improvements ( 15 min airport services all day , used to be only 30 min services in the peak ) , obviously at the expense of other services . might be worth making clear that the dec 2004 major tt change was for ' one ' ge , dec 2005 for ' one ' wa . might also be worth specifying how many stations lost their off-peak service , rather than saying an unquantified ' some ' .
