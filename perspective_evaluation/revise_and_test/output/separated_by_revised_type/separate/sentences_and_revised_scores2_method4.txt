ymmv , but i hear this one a lot and so consider it part of the political discourse . also , history books might be too high a standard ; i doubt chandra levy will make that cut either , but she deserves an article here .

: no , it's good . for every publisher ( or other commercial operation , for that matter ) we want to link to their main page , after all they're their own main authority on what they do . great article , btw , make sure it's linked from more places , ancient rome and so forth .

something which might be worth mentioning is that at least some of these consequences of the axiom of choice have been shown to imply the axiom as well ( tychonoff's theorem , for example ) . i'm not sure which other ones do or don't though .

here's a quote from one of sagan's article in parade magazine in march 1996 called in the valley of the shadow , also published in his last book billions and bilions : i would love to believe that when i die i will live again , that some thinking , feeling , remembering part of me will continue . but much as i want to believe that , and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife , i know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking . the world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth , that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence . far better it seems to me , in our vulnerability , is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides . his wife in the same book wrote that there was no religious awakening or anything like that , he remained true to his beliefs until the very end . i think those prove that he was nothing but a model atheist . i think he would consider an insult putting anything else , especially in encyclopedia .

thank you very much . interestingly , the articles came almoust at the same time , as the english one . i learned about the phenomenon in an english linguistic group and found similar words in german language . there seem to be much more such words in english than in german . best regards - bernd
