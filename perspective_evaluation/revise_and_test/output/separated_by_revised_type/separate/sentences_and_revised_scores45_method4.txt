: digging myself a deeper hole ? is that a threat ? there were no vandalism warnings , there was a note about a page that i made when i initially started editing here that was then removed as i had not read the information about what can and cannot be posted here . what we had was a case of some random user taking an overactive interest in my talk page , a talk page which he had no reason to have an opinion on , i should think that the editors here have something better to do than vandalise talk pages , i guess that guy proved me wrong .

the number 501 is from diogenes laertius . there is no earlier account which gives the exact number . we know that 500 was the size of a typical jury ; but we also know that the number in some cases went as high as 2000 . there was no problem in the case of a tie , because a tie meant acquittal . ( trials weren't always held in a room ; they were sometimes held in the open air ; so there was never a problem of fitting jurors into a room . ) from plato's apology 36a , we know the ratio ( but not the exact numbers ) of jurors who voted for and against conviction .

: i guess that , in your second category ( indirect parliamentarism ) , the most common arrangement is actually for the head of state ( monarch or president ) to appoint a prime minister and , then , appoint all other government of ministers on proposal of the latter . that is what happens both in the uk ( where the power to appoint the government rests with the queen ) and in the france ( where it is the president of the republic who appoints the council of ministers ) . in germany , the federal president also appoints all other federal ministers on the recommendation of the chancellor , but the chancellor him/herself is actually elected by the bundestag , thus making germany fall into your proposed direct parliamentarism category instead .
