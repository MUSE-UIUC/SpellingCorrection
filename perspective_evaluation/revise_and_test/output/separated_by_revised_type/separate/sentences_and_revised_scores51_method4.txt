i asked you for a rationale , not a url link . i'm very aware that there are a lot of idiots or militants around on the internet , and they probably don't know that the laicité concept has since its beginning been openly directed against the catholic church which was thought to be way too much powerful at that time ( 1905 ) . the law about religious symbols in school , although badly written ( the proposal was to ban * all * religious symbols in primary and secondary schools ) is a direct application of this one century-old philosophy as written in the constitution , so this neologism is just not adequate to describe it . this law that you call the french hijab ban neither concerns only the hijab , nor is a ban of the hijab in general , i see hijab every day when i go back to france . also the other lies about muslim girls who would not be able to receive an education have now proven to be false , or very rare . so it's law on secularism , and an alleged example of islamophobia for some islamic militants/multcularism proponents in the us/uk , and does absolutely not match the sentance above islamophobic incidences are a fact , just like anti-semitic acts for the point 2 ) and 3 ) , i appreciate your pov , but it's only that .
