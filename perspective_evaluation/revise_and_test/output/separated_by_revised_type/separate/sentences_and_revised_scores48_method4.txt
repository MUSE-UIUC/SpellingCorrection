as you approach a town to attack it , first offer its people terms for peace . if they accept your terms and open the gates to you , then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor . but if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight , you must attack the town . when the lord your god hands it over to you , kill every man in the town . but you may keep for yourselves all the women , children , livestock , and other plunder . you may enjoy the spoils of your enemies that the lord your god has given you . ( deuteronomy 20:10 -14 ) what kind of lunatic approves of murder , rape , and slavery ? answer : god i don't recognize your false religion .

should we make the same argument for those who self-identify as jews writing holocaust articles ? the only possible rationale i could see for prohibiting self-identified pedophiles from writing articles on people claiming child abuse is that it provides right wing cranks with an opportunity to publicly attack wikipedia . given the collaborative process , it certainly isn't going to make any difference in the quality of the resulting article , and most minor attracted adults editing wikipedia aren't going to publicly announce their orientation anyway .
