shri gautama buddha is only considered by the buddhists as a separate leader . however even buddhists if they study the buddha , they realize that he was only trying to encourage the truth interpretation of the vedas and its arya dharam . buddhist scholar rahula vipola wrote that the buddha was trying to shed the true meaning of the vedas . buddha is said to be a knower of the veda ( vedajña ) or of the vedanta ( vedântajña ) ( sa . myutta , i . 168 ) and ( sutta nipâta , 463 ) . for all inquiries , please read this version of buddha as an avatar of vishnu
