= = question about policy = = hi , i was wondering if you could quickly look at the page unimodal/proposed to see if it violates wikipedia policy . i've been arguing with an admin who replaced the original content with a redirect to personal rapid transit - he says it violates npov and undue weight - but i don't think it does . in any case , i'm not asking you to get involved ( unless of course you want to ) but i'm just wondering if i'm way off base - after all , i am arguing with an admin . thanks .

no such thing as islamic mathematics the religion of islam does not include math , there is no connection . mathematicians who were living in regions were islam was the dominant religion , does not imply that they were islamic mathematicians . the term makes no sense , but is rather used in some sort of vain attempt at associating the glory of the accomplishments of mathematicians and scientists with the religion of islam . the fact of studying the qu'ran makes no impact on one's mathematic ability . the same goes for any other association of a faith with a scientific field . thus editors who are going around weaving terms like islamic mathematicians are using wikipedia as a soap box .

update : ok , since i couldn't remember them , i got ahold of my school's bell schedule . none of the vandalism occured on a wednesday , which is advisory day at my school . that basically just fouls up the bell schedule and cuts 15 minutes from two periods . the significance of that information is that i now don't have a much more narrow list of rooms to look at . the incident on april 28 occured in 6th period , the incident on the 27th occured in 2nd period , and the april 20 vandalism took place in 8th period . judging by how spread out they are , i have absolutely no way of knowing if these were done by the same person . i can , however , ask some friends to check around tommorow ; that should yield something or another . oh , and one last thing : on tuesday and on thursday , i can get on wikipedia sometime around 11:20 to 11:30 to check up on this . if you haven't posted an update sicne the night before at that time , i'll be checking back up on the page about every five minutes or so until 12:45 ishand after that , it'll be at least until 3:00 something before i get home to check it again . if there is any other information that you can provide , let me know . ( port numbers would be great , if you could get them . it wouldn't be too hard for me to get a list of what ports go where at my school . [ the admins are really , really stupid . =)]) busbee
