: i am sorry , but amanjolov is a guy that proposes a proto-türkic script and similar stuff . his ' translation ' is pulled out of thin air . even if we disagree about this , there is the much better established scythian translation by harmatta , which is of course completely incompatible with amanjolov , so at the very least we will have to label both translations as speculative . if amanjolov is at all a reasonable scholar , he will have labelled his own translation as speculative . there is nothing derogatory about the term .
