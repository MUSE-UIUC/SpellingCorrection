::: john strange's own nutjob words : but in view of the lower limit for the existence of caphtor/keftiu i would hesitate to identify in with crete , if there is nothing which definitely warrants such an identification . too bad for him that cretan citynames following kftiw are carved in stone during amenhotep iii . there's nothing to debate because keftiu is ' crete ' with _100%_ certainty . john strange is an idiot .
