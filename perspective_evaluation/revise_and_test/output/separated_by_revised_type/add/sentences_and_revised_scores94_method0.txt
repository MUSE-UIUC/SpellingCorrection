: balamithram has always been an independent magazine . according to the front cover of various issues , it was established in 1920 . i don't recall ever hearing of ammachi write anything for any other magazine , least of all balarama . it's only natural that you don't know about balamithram , because it really lost popularity after balarama came out .
