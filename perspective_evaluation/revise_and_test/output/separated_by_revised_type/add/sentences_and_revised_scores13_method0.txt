hi ! hope you didn't mind the email i was undergoing major wikiwithdrawal and thought i'd share ! would appreciate feedback on pov on treaty of shimonoseki — my attempt to be balanced may need expanded into greater length . please post to the talk there ! thanx . * also need a memory check . did i write you asking that you take over organosulfur compounds which i stubbed as far as 27 y.o. chemistry will take me ! or was that one of the messages i lost the other night ? no matter , here's another handoff ! looks to me that hydrogen sulfide needs some serious attention as well . ( i was a chem major myself once upon a yesterday ) . ( no hurry from me ! ) * also seem to have put this laptop into a zoomed in screen mode - text is about double sized from what i'd normally viewed , and my office and other computers are unaffected ; would be better to have this mode on the big screen upstairs , vice this dinky 14 screen ! any ideas of how that might happen ( the touch pad does some weird things ) , and how to reverse it ? it's wiki-related as does not apply to other internet windows . thanx — frankb ::: || 28 june 2005 12:13 ( utc )
