: i'm not sure i understand your reply and i'm not sure you read my talk entry at all . again , i realize the difference between a city , a metropolitan statistical area , a consolidated metropolitan statistical area , an area of urbanization , etc . my addition was in no way subjective or original research , but from u.s. census bureau statistics , and was intended to make the jacksonville article consistent with wikipedia articles covering nearly every other major u.s. city ( i.e. , putting the central city's surrounding metro into perspective in the opening without having to download an excel worksheet list in references ) . this information in no way detracts from this article and otherwise , the opening is simply a list of trivial details . at the very least , the opening paragraph of this article should state that the jacksonville metro pop . ( yes , metro , not city ) is ranked 42nd in the u.s. as of 2005 , but adding that it is 4th in florda does not hurt . i would add this accurate and scientific info myself , but i seem to be prevented from doing so , which i believe is totally against the spirit of wikipedia .
