hey . it is my judgement in the matter of david tombe that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism , but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner . you have to change this attitude on your part . your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus , even if it is demonstrably wrong !!!! in my experience david is absolutely right in what he says . you guys are of course wrong . you prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism . that is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated . every day i find dumb stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia . i think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that i can determine . your blocking policy seems to be the source of the continued errors in wikipedia . i dont reccomend any one using it for any reason . it is just plain innacurate .
