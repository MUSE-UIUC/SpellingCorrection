i feel like only coloring half isn't telling the whole story . how about a lighter shade of reddish-brown , e.g. zinnwaldite as the back ? i don't like the idea of highlighting all four in green ... can't tell the difference between winners and losers if all the same color-why color at all ?. alternatively , i like the idea of the top two ( those who advance ) in a light color . perhaps we could have the top two in green and then bold the last match ( e.g. if sweden won their last match , their total in the w column would be bold ) .

now you're being unfair to me : i've never said anything against the english ( indeed i have a much closer connection to england and britain than most foreigners ); you , on the other hand , have clearly said that you don't like the germans . ergo , it is your edits that are suspect . ( stpaul ) i'm not editing the german people page , so whether i like them or not is irrelevant . in fact , i don't dislike any specific individual germans . what i dislike is autocracy , fascism , and the sort of people and political mentalities that support it .
