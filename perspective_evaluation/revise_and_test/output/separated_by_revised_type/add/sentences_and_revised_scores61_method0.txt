= = = = my numerous beefs with the template : * poor coding ** clear : right ; is preferable to unnecessary line breaks ** a single text-align : center ; is preferable to repeating needlessly align = center for every cell ** a width definition is preferable to margins , and more commona cross wikipedia . ** there is absolutely no need to have the comment be inserted in every page as it is specifically intended only for the template page . * there is no apparent reason to have a category in the template . the category would be just as well put independantly . * the link in the header was misleading as implying an article limited to western russia . unless kremlin actually is , but i doubt that , and can't really tell anyway . * no background color in the header , unlike 90% of wikipedia footers * picture enlarging header unnecesssarily , at the very least it should be reduced and move in the content section of the footer . * 80% is unnecearily small for a simple footer like this . most wikipedia footers do very well with 90% now i'd like to know why you reverted the entire thing ( including a totally legit categorization uunder category : russian navigational boxes ) instead of just adjusting what you weren't happy with ( which appears to me to be only the comment's location and the image ) .
