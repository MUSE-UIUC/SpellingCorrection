july 2006 ( utc ) i understand i am a bit late in this discussion and it has probably already concluded and everyone is probably already over it but i have to say the following ; american english is quite simply english for the stupid man ( and of course your country would require it . ) your version of english is over-simplified . i am sick of americans always thinking that their way is the only way . why shouldn't you accept our spelling ? webster was incorrect in his changing of the english language . if i was to start spelling things incorrectly would that mean that it is a new way of spelling and i would be a reformist rather than an idiot ? i think not . 09:04 , 17
