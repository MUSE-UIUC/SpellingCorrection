i see . so allegedly some scots in scotland do not recognize a scottish diaspora ? what is the reasoning behind that though ? is that the main problem here ? why not just mention that in the article with a proper citation ? care must be taken to differentiate between a resident/citizen of scotland and a descendant of the aforementioned historic people of scotland ( ie : the ethnic scots ) .
