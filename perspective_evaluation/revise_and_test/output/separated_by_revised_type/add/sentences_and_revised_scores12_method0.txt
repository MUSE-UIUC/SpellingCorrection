i'm not among the ones who edited this article , but i mostly agree to your points . the current contents can be included elsewhere . the contents do not match the article title . reasonable , unreasonable , & other kinds of hostilities exist between peoples of the two countries . if someone can write about those things , the appropriate titles could be korean anti-japanism and japanese anti-koreanism .

: this is not easy to answer . more than 20 people worked on it , generally speaking each one adding a sentence or changing some bit . each one must have used a different source of information — many must have simply used their own knowledge . : however , if there is a particular bit that look to you fishy , that's much easier . go through the page history ( use the history button at the top ) and see when it was added and by whom . then ask that person . people usually respond very nicely to such requests . you might want to read the relevant policy , verifiability .

= = confucianism = = confucius predates aristotle in using family as a model for the state . he believed the child should be subordinate to the parent , younger brother to the older , wife to husband , and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the father of the nation . the state as the family writ large was the most harmonious , orderly , and natural form of government . this was later expanded to cover international relations ( i.e. the emperor of china as the older brother of the king of korea ) . confucian family theory is still espoused in north korea to justify their method of leadership succession . should this be included in the article ?
