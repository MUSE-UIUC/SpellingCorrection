:: i'll venture to speak for pod as well as myself and state quite categorically that it'll be a cold day in hell before the film and the mask make their way into the guy fawkes article , for reasons that have already been discussed to death elsewhere . this is symptomatic of a deeper malaise among too many wikipedia editors , who struggle under the illusion that links must be symmetrical . sure , a link to guy fawkes from the v for vendetta article will help to give readers some useful background and throw light on some of the film's themes , but the film was fuck all to do with fawkes's or his legacy . there was an even more striking example i recall in the moors murders article , which at one time listed every pop song that had ever even tangentially referred to the murders . no . time some people grew up and realised this isn't a project to produce a children's encyclopedia of popular trivia , or at least that it ought not to be .
