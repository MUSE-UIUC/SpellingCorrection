: you're just a trigger-happy idiot . i don't think someone with your history ( as is evident merely by reading your talk page ) should be so casual in classifying other people's edits as vandalism . i realize that wikipedia has by now largely turned into bullying-summercamp for you frustrated-with-the-real-world type admins , but still . some common sense , more impulse control and less hysteria , and your toys will last much longer .
