= = definitely merge = = honestly , they're basically the same article with a slightly different name . if you were to just add stock characters as a subsection which is only for movies , you'd have no more trouble . what's taking so much discussion about it are we in congress , or something ?!

( utc ) shorne , sorry to break it to you , but referring to the holodomor and the famines in russia in general as a holocaust does not diminish the holocaust against the jews . unless , of course , you wish to say that eliminating the social class of peasants is in some way trivial , and hence it would trivialize the killing of the jews as an ethnic group by association . calling the holodomor and the related events a holocaust rather puts those events in the right perspective : there was both callous and deliberate killing of the undesired class during the holodomor that was not principally any different from the shoa . have a look at hannah arendt's writings and you will see what i mean . however , from your comments regarding the alleged ' bias ' against left-wing pov's here , i assume that you are in fact somewhat of a soviet apologist . since i am myself a social-democrat , i can't say that there is any kind of bias against left-wing pov's here . rather , there seems to be a fortunate tendency towards limiting both right-wing and left-wing extremism . or , in other words , wikipedia seems to have adopted a cultural most befitting to an open society , and rather hostile towards totalitarian ideas . how fortunate . 05:13 , 17 september 2005

:: haughty and cryptic . ddv , when i offer anything concrete it does not come in magazine-like abundance because it is not strip mined backfill from propaganda sites . such as your egypt-women 1 and 2 pictures , which don't show egyptian women at all but royal concubines gifted to egypt's pharaohs by neighboring sovereigns . this is basic egyptology twisted to fleece the undiligent . disingenuous to the core .

signatures are not worthless . they're basic . if there is a server problem with my signature i'll spend an hour making sure it gets there . as for the commentslost . really , lost , and with nothing else to say except that the main page should rise above revert wars . if it doesn't have an npov tag and is long enough it shouldn't be removed .
