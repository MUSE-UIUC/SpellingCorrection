you might want to take a look at this page to get an idea of the kinds of external links that are appropriate . the links that you're including in several articles are coming quite close to the appearance of spamming the encyclopedia . if you have any questions , let me know by clicking on the talk link in my signature . |

nice additions to the instrument articles . rackett is sure a weird beast ! i've played with one occasionally i don't do double reeds , but i had to toy with it anyway . by the way , when modifying entries like sackbutt , you should check first to see if it automatically goes to sackbut ( as it does ) , in which case there's not much reason to change the spelling ( considering how many spellings there are for sackbut . ) i assume you're a double-reed player with a fondness for renaissance horns ?

: who said anything about no longer arguing ? i ' gree , it can be fun as well as constructive ( as in our case on this article ) . my suggestion was that we might be able to argue it out on talk pages , rather than jerking revisions back and forth on the main article . : or not - jerking around can be fun and constructive too . :
