i have never seen so many stupid people pretending to be halfway smart as in this section . it's cobol , not cobol , and it does not represent years as strings , you morons . you use two digits - digits , not strings - in working storage , denoting them as ' 99 ' , meaning directly two digits . in ibm's own collating sequence of course . why don't you people just bugger out of here and leave this high brow stuff to people with an education and an iq above that of your ilk - that of the common ape ?
