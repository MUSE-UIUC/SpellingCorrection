= = elizabeth bowles-lyon , cc = = hi not that i know what i'm talking about , but i was very confused to see the late queen mother listed as a c.c. under her christian , maiden name . she was once the queen consort of canada , and she was in any event married , so i would expect her to be listed under her regnal name , or ( if the order of canada has gone democratic ) at least as elizabeth bowles-lyon windsor , odd as that sounds . as i say , though , i'm an american , so i am clueless . could explain this to me please ? thanks ,

2005 ( utc ) :: to anonymous user(s ) 220.237.18.12 / 61.29.58.114 : first of all , it is proper wikipedia : wikiquette to sign and date your posts to talk pages . this is an essential aspect of communication here . it helps other users understand the progress and evolution of a dialog . failure to do so is confusing . for example , 61.29.58.114 added to the unsigned post by 220.237.18.12 . are you the same user at a different ip or are you both just showing bad form ? i have no clue ! it's confusing . :: to i obviously totally agree with your statement that perhaps other personal websites should also be held into question . we need to be very stringent in applying wp's standards regarding reliable sources . as the wp standard advises , “ wikipedia articles should use reliable sources . edits for which no credible references are provided may be deleted by any editor .

:: no , it's a very poor summary . the plot of the book does not involve a modern vatican conspiracy at all . the shadowy pope in the novel is a reformist liberal , and the apparent opus dei conspiracy turns out to have been orchestrated by an anti-catholic . the novel refers to supposed rc attempts to suppress the truth about jesus and mary in the past . it's not always clear whether the medieval church is supposed to know that the marriage occured or whether they genuinely believe it's a lie . 21:30 16 aug 2005 ( utc )

olivi deserves a better article than this . he was much more influential than this article suggests . in addition to his interesting apocalyptic speculations , he was also a potent philosopher in his own right who wrote on ( to name only the most well known ) papal ' innerrability ' and economics . jr.
