there's no such thing as pollution on a digital forum , dumbass . no one in #memes or #atheism cared about the article being vanity when it was negative . it was only until the article became a regular wikipedia article and not vanity that i heard the howl's of protests from a gang of gutless thugs who wouldn't dare raise a finger unless they were cowering behind their computer screens . your campaign is a lame attempt to delete one article . the cleaning up of wikipedia . kind of the cleaning up of germany ? i guess you're glad that clean up failed or you would have never been born . take your lame campaigns somewhere else . your mind games are boring .
