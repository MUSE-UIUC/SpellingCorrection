= = assistance request = = hello again . if you have some spare time , i was wondering if you could help out at one of the articles i have on my watch list , namely contrat nouvelle embauche , i have been trying to help out myself in recent weeks , with mixed results , as there appear to be two main editors involved with very different opinions . unfortunately , i'm reaching my limit of usefulness as many of the references used are in french , so i can do very little background reading myself . i was hoping that you might ideally suited to take a look , being legal minded ( it's the new employment contract ) , have more french than me , and are diplomatic as the current discussion is getting a little heated again , based on what a french source does or does not say . ( of course , feel free to have a look and run away ) regards ,

stop making vague conspiracy jibes , and either find one factual error in the following paragraph , or leave it in : the main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres ( 57 feet ) in width . no wreckage was found in the immediate impact zone at the front of the pentagon . the lawn in front of the building was unmarked . within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building , approximately 9 metres ( 27 feet ) in width . the pentagon is composed of five concentric rings . only the outer three rings were penetrated during the impact . the upper floors of the first ring collapsed , but those of the second and third remained intact . at the end of the third ring was a circular ' punch out ' hole , again 9 metres ( 27 feet ) in diameter . the wingspan of a boeing 757 is 38 metres ( 114 feet ) .
