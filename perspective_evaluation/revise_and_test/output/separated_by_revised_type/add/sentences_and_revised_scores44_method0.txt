::: exactly , i have done a google search for anything relating to carrie underwood and chad eagleton , as well as search of the oklahoma today website and found no verifying information . i think we should face the facts that mia2007 , nsuboy , txmaster and the non-registered ip user who adds the information is himself chad eagleton , who was fortunate enough to snap a picture with carrie underwood , and claims to be her boyfriend .

= = vandalism manifesto . pass to all wikians = = vandalism is good . vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm . vandals do their thing all over wiki , 24/7 , from frustration and hatred , because incompetent editors who have no skills , no degrees , no expertise , usually no names , have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others . vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers ( as in get a life ) who do 7000 edits , 10,000 edits a year and who have actual watch lists of 1,300 or more and are proud of it . these jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized , over and over as long as they are in effect , vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop . vandals keep no-life editors , admins , bureaucrats and stewards honest , or at least busy , reverting the reverts they get on their own pages . vandalism is good . it helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns . the culture of wikipedia is very , very sick , and vandals are needed to cull the herd . support your local vandal . vandal god
