this page seems a little misleading . the reason that the midpoint rule gives an accurate answer is that the acceleration is constant . the midpoint is actually the analytical solution when the acceleration is constant . however , this is not generally applicable to systems where the acceleration is not constant .

this discussion about the links is ridiculous . i've looked at all the sites , and i don't think any of them should really be on here . what do they add to the article anyway ? if you feel you must have some links , then why not have the official company link and maybe one of each ( pro and con ) to be fair . seems there's fighting between owners of the con sites , but it should not be done here . the pinkins shears site looks like it was done by a 10-year-old and is next to impossible to navigate . it seemed like most agreed upyourcadilac was a better site to include here . so lets put up the good links and then leave the section alone . it is wrong for a site owner to keep posting her own link .
