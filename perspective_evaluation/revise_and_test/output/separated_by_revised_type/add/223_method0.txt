i've sanitised bushell's language and deleted the earlier quote which was far more offensive ( bushell claimed he wouldn't like to fuck her . ) how can it be concluded this language is acceptable but calling trott a dumpling isn't ? this smacks of hypocrisy and an obvious anti-bias to new editors on eastenders pages .
