sorry about the minor character deletion ; i probably should have been more judicious but the character descriptions were a bit informal and i thought it better to delete them rather than edit them with inaccurate information .

= = sails as wings ? = = i think that this might be an oversimplification of the matter , as it depends largely on both the type of rigging being used and the direction ( relevant to the wind direction ) that one wishs to go . for instance , many of the large square rigged ships did move essentially through the force of the wind pushing on the sail . i suppose technically the wind is piling up behind the sail ( thus high pressure area ) and the difference in pressure between the higher and lower pressure areas on opposite sides of the sail causes it to move , which is the same principle as that which generates lift . however , unlike in the case of aerofoils ( aka wings ) there is * not * a higher wind speed going across the back of the sail than the front . in short , while the pressure differential as cause of movement remains valid , the cause of these pressure differences is not the same as for wings . lift ( force ) anyway , hope this helps . zitchas

so many people spend so much time on focusing on the bad side to the royal family that no one spends any time concentrating on whats really important about them . every single person in the world have good and bad sides to them , but no one spends time to explore the godd nature about what ever they are critizing . they are just like ordinary people only with abit of wealth and power , why not give them a chance like the courts in britian to day who even give crimanals a chance even when mudering some one in some cases , i am not comparing the royals to crimanals but i am simply saying ' every body in life gets a chance ' , some people just always look at the bad sides to life . are you that person ? olivia garside 14 years old
