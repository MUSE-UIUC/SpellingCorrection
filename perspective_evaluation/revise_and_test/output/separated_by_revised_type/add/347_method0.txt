wow you're one of those guys whose idea of contribution is retribution by deleting others ' comments , aren't you . figures . the ' gender gap ' will never be closed unless wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on . the only ' cultural bias ' wikipedia has is that it is ' biased ' towards objectively important subjects such as science , which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the western society , which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all . the ' undue coverage of women ' comes from the fact that there are less notable women . insisting on ' equal coverage ' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people . the policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women , such as ill-conceived politeness , will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done . ~~~~
