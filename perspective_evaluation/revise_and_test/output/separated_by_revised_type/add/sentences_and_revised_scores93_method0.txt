::: yes , that was an rpj rant . but criticism articles really are required sometimes ( here's a great example ) and often they create clutter if all the separate objections to an idea are left in place . the general rule is that the minority views can be collected as a subarticle , so long as care is taken to treat them as a subarticle by somehow summarizing them in the main article ( this does not have to be exhaustive ) , and vice versa , which probably we should be careful to do in the main jfk assassination article . and so long as rebuttal on both sides is a part of both articles , which i hope we've accomplished here by having a good section on the one-shooter wc view in the jfk assassination theories article , and mentioning that other views than the wc's exist , in the main article.in line with wikipedia's semi-policy of assuming good faith , the creator of the new article is probably sincerely convinced that there is so much information about a certain aspect of a subject that it justifies a separate article . there is no consensus whether a criticism of .... article is always a pov fork . at least the criticism of ... article should contain rebuttals if available . and the original article should contain a summary of the criticism of ... article . i know i'm going to get flack for pushing so heavily for the wc view even in light of the fact that supposedly it's not the most popular view among the general public . unfortunately , the general public's view is not informed , and is warped by the slick oliver stone jfk , which no movie producer is going to spend as much money to rebutt with a movie which is true to facts as we know them ; plus the hsca shocker with the dictabelt , which got way more airtime than its rebuttal , later . all of this being symptomatic of one of the problems which drives wp :v toward untruthfullness , which is that truth is quite often dull and not very entertaining , and sometimes it's hard to find spokespeople for it . jimbo wales thinks that if something is true it should have plenty of citable supporters , but sometimes that's just not the case . if posner's book had been called lee harvey oswald did it , which was a fairer title , it wouldn't have sold .

2006 ( utc ) i have moved two huge discussions , one about the plans web-site generally and one about linking to that site from this article , to a special page for this subject only ; this brings the two together and allows this talk page to regain a sense of proportion . i hope that all can see the sense of this ( i am not trying to cut off discussion , which can continue on that page ) . 04:22 , 20 august

: yes , i agree : the article could do with some expansion . i'd also like to see something on waist scabbards verses back scabbards . seems as though the design of a back scabbard would have to be rather different to allow one to even draw a sword from it over one's shoulder . at least if my fooling around with faux swords is any indication . )
