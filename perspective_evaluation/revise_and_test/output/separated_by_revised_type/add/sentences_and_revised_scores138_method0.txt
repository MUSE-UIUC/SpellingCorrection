so nice to see people talking behind my back . i can call an article mine if i wrote it , honestly what's your problem h ? i don't care if people improve on it , but when you see your hard work and research spoiled by some untermensch who failed his english classes , you'll probably want to fix it too . the dh article was fine as it was , concise , accurate , thorough . recent edits turned it into an unreadable mess , which repeated information over again , was unnecessarily complex in it's layout , had entire paragraphs copied from the new dh trades , had section headers that weren't populated , had info box fields that were totally irrelevant to the character . if a little bit of new information that is useful got lost in the process , that's because the article was so messed up i only had time to fix the main issues . i figured someone else could fix the little bits remaining if they wanted , like you for example . don't you think your time would have been better spent adding the information back in in a way that properly integrated with the flow of the article , rather than whining on the discussion pages ?
