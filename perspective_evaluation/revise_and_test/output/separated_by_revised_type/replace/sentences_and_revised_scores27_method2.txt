= = npov dispute = = just so this isn't lost by the two suspiciously tangential talk page sections added just above this one , here is a minor sample of the current npov dispute over this article . in my interpretation , the early october version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrase's usage , and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre . more mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed . the article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a conspiracy theory is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre . also , generally and commonly considered in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for npov . the new version of the article seems to be saying a lot less than the old version , we should go through the diff line by line . did someone ever justify those massive changes ? though some of them were good .
