: i am indoctrinated ? when it clearly says it ended in a stalemate in another section is states , india couldn't see an quick end to the conflict so it asked the united nations help . and that pakistan had taken 2-5ths of kashmir . the pakistan army had taken land , you're the one that added the modern usage section . why are you removing the information i am adding if you're right ? why are you removing information i add from the sources which contradict your claims . how did it lose more soilders when the article says the following : the intensity of the conflict and the inability to forsee a quick end to the conflict without involving considerable resources on the part of india to expel the pakistani forces led indian leaders to approach the united nations who ultimately introduced observers in june 1948 . a un brokered cease-fire went into effect on jan 1 , 1949 . in all , 1,500 soldiers died on each side during the war and pakistan was able to acquire roughly two-fifths of kashmir which it established as azad kashmir , meaning free kashmir . this is taking about 1947 so how did pakistan take a drubbing ? when india was running to the united nations for help ? and when pakistan had taken lad ? how is that a drubbing ? this is what i want to know . and about 1965 it says : pakistani army the indo-pakistan war of 1965 ended in a stalemate that ended in a stalemate , so again how did you manage to get drubbing out of that article is beyond me . you've been adding your own commentary to it .
