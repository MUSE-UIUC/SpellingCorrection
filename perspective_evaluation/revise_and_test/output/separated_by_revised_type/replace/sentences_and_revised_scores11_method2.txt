= = categories = = good eye on those awful pro-blank categoriesi think they only lasted a few minutes before getting listed . i supported deletion for all four . i'm not sure what to do about category : lgbt rights opposition and its subcategory , anti-gay rights legislation . the same user put the deletion template on them but didn't actually list them on the deletions page , so now they're in limbo . the names are pov , but there isn't really a better name , and the rights opposition one has already been through an inconclusive vote . since you're an admin , i thought you might know what to do . ps your user page is really interesting , especially the part about not editing physics articles . there is a typo , though : overwhelming should be overwhelmingly . i thought you'd want to know .

* wait a sec , nufy8 . in a very old version of darth malak's page , it said he was succeeded by the triad of traya , nihilus , and sion . then i realized this could be impossible , because traya was the master of both . because of this , she succeeded malak , and in turn sion and nihilus both succeeded their master . since i have not read up that much on thier histories , i asssume they didn't murder each other . it seems sion was somehow convinced by exile to kill himself , but i don't know what happened to nihilus .
