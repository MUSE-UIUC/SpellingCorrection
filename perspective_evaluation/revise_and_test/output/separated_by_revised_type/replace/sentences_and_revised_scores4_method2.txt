i , as a person of scottish heritage , really admire richard mackay and the hope he summons in the hearts of scottish football fans . to delete this topic would be an attack on our nation . i think i speak for the majority of scotland when i say that the deletion of a topic on a scottish hero such as this , would be offensive towards our culture . every true fan of football has heard of richard mackay . only the ignorant could deny his significant contribution to football , and scottish culture as a whole .

different , but related . anal-oral contact could mean just about anything , plus since there is a technical term available , that's what we should be using . if ass to mouth is the only reason why we're using anal-oral contact instead of anilingus i think it's a poor reason . i could as easily claim that fellatio should be moved to genital-oral contact because some people like to like their partners ' balls .

: yep , that's a good solution . i also like the way linguasphere takes inhabitation into account . the layout i have chosen for this series of maps does not permit such subleties . for maps like this that's not really a problem though ; they are only meant to present a quick overview of the distribution of the phylum . ¶
