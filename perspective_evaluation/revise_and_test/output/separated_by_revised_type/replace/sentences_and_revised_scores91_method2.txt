: the reason so many userboxes are being userfied and deleted from template space is because they are not relevant to the wikipedia project . this has been an ongoing debate for many months now , and i personally don't have any sympathy for anyone who continues to try to create these unhelpful userboxes in template space . wikipedia is not here for you to create userboxes ; it is here to produce a free encyclopedia .

the testimony of middle-eastern bisexuals i have met , as well as the sworn testimony of a ( straight ) friend of iranian extraction , are very convincing and persuasive . the cultural purdah under which women are kept from male company in the middle east makes institutional bisexuality an absolutte necessity , even if other cultural norms preclude its more open acknowledgement . ::

independents hi roisterer - regarding the edit , the reason i reverted it was because it would have been the odd one out of all the electoral districts . whilst the white colour and a real name already shows that they're an independent , i wouldn't object per se for changing their names to the word independent , however if you wish to do this please go through all the electorates and do the same thing so there is consistency . and if you do decide to change them from their name to independent , please fill in independent instead of just independent . thanks !
