this article needs to be touched up !!! i wish i could do it , but i'm not very experienced at writing wikipedia articles , and am hardly the right person who knows enough about this subject to do it . it's just that this is an amazing piece ; a piece that represents its time , and has a lot underneath the surface . i think that as long as multiple povs of the story are represented , then there is no need to worry about pov .

:: is this a surprise ? energy is highly political . in the midwest you get votes by supporting ethanol/corn . in california you get votes by supporting solar and wind . in florida you get votes with the anti-castro lobby by putting a tariff on foreign sugar and ethanol . in texas , you get votes for supporting oil . the biggest political problem with biofuel is that it would probably be cheaper to grow the crops in other countries , and that's not going to get you any votes .
