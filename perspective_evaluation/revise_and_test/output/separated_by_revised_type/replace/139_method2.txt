with midazolam and alfentanil iv , the synergistic effects knock out the ability to sense co2 levels in the blood - so all voluntary respiration stops - its used in intensive care for people on mechanical ventilators to stop them fighting the machine , but is adminsitered in the nhs on side wards mainly - co2 just builds up in the blood , but the midazolam and morphine levels are so high , they dont twitch and upset the bitches of nurses who know exactly what they are doing when they inject this stuff , and dont really give a toss one way or the other .
