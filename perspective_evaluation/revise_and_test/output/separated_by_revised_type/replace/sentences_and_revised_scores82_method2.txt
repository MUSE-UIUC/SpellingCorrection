= = other games = = hi pr . sorry your article was deleted . argument-by-exception doesn't tend to work here : previous creation or deletion of articles has no bearing on the creation or deletion of other articles . however , if you have a specific reason to object to another article's existance ( other than my article was deleted so this one should be deleted too ) then you need to tag it with {{ subst : afd }} . that produces a tag that gives you access to the afd process . follow the red link it creates and on that new page add {{ subst : afd2 | pg = pagename | text = reason }} ~~~~ where pagename is the name of the article ( case sensitive ) and reason is your detailed reasoning why the article should be deleted . finally , go to wp : afd . there's a link marked add a new entry . click that link and , at the bottom of the page , add {{ subst : afd3 | pg = pagename }} where pagename is is the name of the article ( case sensitive ) . the community will then judge the article on its merits . i hope this helps .

this is a complete misinterpreatation of what really happenned . oliverdefleur was the sockpuppet of a blocked user and admin zoe than reverted his contribution because we are duty bound to revert the comments of blocked users . i didnt realise what was happening , reverted zoe and replied to the comment , then when i realised oliverdefleur was blocked i reverted his and my comment . this had nothing to do with the passports issue or even with this article . the opage is certainly not werong nor is there any kind of conspiracy going on ,

:::: wouldn't you just claim that any source that supports smitty's position is either pro-terrorist or anti-semitic ? that's your whole game . the idea that basic ideas like lots of people , including most leading human rights groups , have argued that israel commits human rights violations in the occupied territories , and a lot of people , including most arabs , disagree with the idea that the arabs were the aggressors in 1948 is ridiculous .
