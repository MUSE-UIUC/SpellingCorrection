::::::: luke , you cannot possibly split explicit moderates and apathetic don't knows in half and claim them as self-identifying liberals . do you have any actual evidence for your ' most undecideds are intimidated liberals ' claim ? that's hogwash . most undecideds are , in fact , undecided ! the simple fact remains is that there are significantly more self-identifying conservatives in the us than there are self-identifying liberals . politicians understand that , and thus depending upon party either attack or run away from the explicit liberal label , especially in statewide and evenmoreso nationwide elections . are you claiming that this phenomenon has had no effect on the development and course of recent american liberalism , and is thus unworthy of mention here ? silly .
