may 2006 ( utc ) :: as far as i know it has been stated that several universes do not fit into the actual accepted universe of wold newton which integrates with the dc comics universe thanks to alan moore . thus marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of steven rogers and peter parker whose worlds do not clash with the dc universe chronology . as for star wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the wold newton universe , only star wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element , basically a universe that predates that of the earth . and tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm , the same applies to dungeons & dragons , world of warcraft and warhammer . however the world of faeries is related thanks to king arthur and shakespeare as well as c.s. lewis and hans christian anderson/brothers grimm . harry potter's world also doesn't tie in to the wold newton as far as i have seen . and as for looney tunes and disney the only way they might tie-in is through who framed roger rabbit which has as of yet to be linked . of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't , the only reason i added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those universes or worlds were not present . perhaps it could be stated that although they are not accepted within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole . piecraft 04:50 , 22
