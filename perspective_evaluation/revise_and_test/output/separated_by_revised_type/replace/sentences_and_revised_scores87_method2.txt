well , in this case , mister late- er ... lindelof is seemingly holding everything up . that's more common at marvel than dc , but by no means a good thing . the rumor is likely true and indicates that lindelof is to blame , rather than anyone else . ; . .

, 1 august 2006 ( utc ) : see , that's always the way i'd considered it , too ( although i'm a catholic who supports liverpool ) . however , the debate still rages fiercely - i used to work at radio merseyside on the roger phillips phone-in , and it would crop up all the time . as soon as one person said on the phone that everton were always the catholic club , you'd get twenty people phoning in to say they were the protestant club . it's such a fervent debate that there's really just not the space it needs on the wikipedia entry , and surely the fact that there's even a debate shows that the religious affiliations of the two clubs aren't as ingrained in their existence as those of rangers and celtic - as such , i don't think it's necessary to include it . 14:47
