:: a short answer , since it just feels wrong to edit . i know the limits of npa and i'm agressive because that's my personality . when i skirt it , i do so because a person is either acting in a disinginous manner or is blatantly and openly violating a policy and refusing to see it . i am too sarcastic as well , which does not always translate well over the net . i think i'll go to lunch and come back this weekend , to work on some articles i've been typing out at home . if this answer isn't sufficient , i would strongly prefer to give a more complete one once my block expires . this user is going offline |

= = triple crown and grand slam champions = = i am not and was never looking to start trouble , all i am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references . the triple crown and the grand slam are what we have been going back and forth on . my contention is that the intercontinental and united states championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a crown/slam . you say no because wwe never explicitly came out and said so . on 8-4-06 , jbl said he was a slam winner . a wwe wrestler on wwe tv said he accomplished a wwe sanctioned feat . it was said that no outside source has verified this , but no one in wwe has disputed jbl's claim either . also it must be pointed out that pwi has always considered the two championships as equal . when pwi used to do their rankings for wwf and wcw , the i-c and u.s. titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective world champions . the same holds true today when they do the rankings for raw ( i-c ) and smackdown ( u . s . ) . pwi is considered the main source for what is considered a world title and their word is law here on wikipedia . they also have always maintained that the i-c and u.s. championships are of equal value and of equal standing . as i have said before , i am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to wikipedia , only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact , based on logic and references . jbl , pwi , and many other wiki users have backed up this definition . ( look at the triple crown champion discussion page ) . all i ask is my contribution be allowed to stand as i respectfully feel that i am in the right on this one . thank you for your time . vlh .

of course we cannot cut and paste the enitre books here , you have to read them yourselves , but they have been protrayed in the press . see : 12 3 4 obviously the press always has a special way of presenting information to draw more attention by the readers , but those articles are very much in line with the books . some people do not want to leave them as references to the books and then we have people like you who claim that there are no sources .
