:: well , i think we agree to disagree ; this article is not easy to follow given the volume of text . i'm aware of only one discussion prior to ours ; where are the others ? as well , objections were noted previously : the article has grown significantly in size and is now unwieldy almost to the point of lacking utility . i am also not proposing headings for all ranks : only the flag and officer ranks ( which are lengthy sections on their own ) . lastly , any user can collapse the toc on their screen . :: as for the wikifying of real-world terms : the article does not at all link to the articles/concepts of rank and insignia that are described in the title and only weakly described after that . that is bad form and should be upfront , not at the end . :: i acknowledge and appreciate your contributions to the article , but resistance to changing it and your reversion can be perceived as exerting ownership over it . to that end , i think it prudent to initiate a new discussion or rfc regarding these issues to enhance the article , and we should be guided by the results of that . thanks !

= = this shouldn't be allowed to continue . = = the author of this article has his main focus clearly defined . it is the so-called controversey around the site . this leads me to believe that he was kicked off the site and/or his stories deleted and he is using wikipedia to get back . this ' free ' online encylopedia isn't a stage to enact vengence , it's to provide unbiased information on the subject . true this subject points out that it has one million stories , but it doesn't say anything positive and instead focuses on the negative . if the creator can't be unbiased he should step aside and let worthy people write about this . this would not be me , as fanfiction.net is one of my favorite sites .

actually , a producer on superman homepage seemed to imply that the continuity is a mixture of smallville and the movies . the producer said we won't be dealing with superman's origin , because if you're under 30 , smallville is your origin story , and if your over 30 , the christopher reeve movies are your origin story . plus , this version of lex seems to be closer to mike rosenbaum than gene hackman .
