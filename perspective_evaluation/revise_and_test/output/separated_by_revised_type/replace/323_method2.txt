: yes . whilst it is illegal to * be * drunk whilst editing wikipedia , nobody can ever actually be banned for editing it whilst drunk , because it is also illegal to ask anyone if they are drunk . and if anyone is asked , they don't have to answer . this may seem bizarre , but it is also the same rules that apply in the house of commons , and also may fondly remind us of the laws of thermodynamics , where it is impossible to break even until you reach absolute zero , but of the law says you cannot ever reach absolute zero in a finite number of steps .
