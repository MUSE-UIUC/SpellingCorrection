: thanks . that would be great . i am sure there are many rooms for improvements . i just made a framework for it . i think it is very important that we use iranian terminology rather than western terminology to write an article about iran . but it is very difficult for nonexperts . thanks .

= = physical chemistry = = yeah , i was reading around it and it's pretty bad as is .. as i see it , the physical chemistry article should be a similar kind of article as the thermodynamics article is ; an overview of the key principles included in the actual thing itself as well as the foundation of it . i've not got too many books on physical chemistry on the article itself , i've only got about 4 of those mentioned . the majority of the books i have featuring physical chemistry tell me also that chemical physics seem to be some forms of misprints , or so there was a story on how someone published the name incorrectly due to the fact they thought it was mostly based in chemistry , so therefore it was chemistry with physics in it ; chemical physics . not too sure about it though .. chemical physics could be a pseudonym for thermodynamics of activation or something similar ; who knows ? the books , i guess ! -)
