concerning the question of how h . a . lorentz first had arrived at the lorentz transformation ( i.e. concerning his ' testamony ' , as e4mmacro calls it ) , i found now a relevant remark in k . f . schaffner , space and time in lorentz , poincaré and einstein : divergent approaches to the discovery and development of the special theory of relativity ; in : machamer , p . k ., and turnbull , r . g . ( eds . ) ( 1976 ) motion and time , space and matter , interrelations in the history of the philosophy of science , ohio state university press , chapter seventeen , p . 465 : lorentz thought that einstein had arrived at experimental results that were in essential agreement with those that he , lorentz , had obtained , and that einstein had ' simply postulated ' what he had ' deduced , with some difficulty and not altogether satisfactorily , from the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field . ' schaffner's citation is taken from p . 230 of lorentz's the theory of the electrons '' of 1909 . how is it possible to deduce a correct result in a not altogether satisfactory manner without knowing the final result in advance ?

, 30 may 2006 ( utc ) i have found the hard way that when you ask and beg and chittle away politely , and get ignored and deleted , the way to fix it is sometimes unfortunately to make a bigger noise . thats unfortunate , but the reality is i did try every other option available to me , including much calmer adresses to jimbo , and have gotten zero results . so the fault here goes to the system which forces me to roar when i'd rather discuss . 17:36

you are using wikipedia as an proselytist media for catholicism . i will report you to jimbo wales . your comments are no neutral , and are very defamotories against evangelicals . according to you , proven persecution by catholics must to be written only in politically correct -and previously aproved by catholic league- terms ?. and you think to delete the article on holocaust , because it is no neutral toward nazis ?. you don t have time for reading sources and documents , but edit and delete articles linked to these same documents ?. tries to be serious , some people writing here are serious and mature people , no lazy teenagers as you .
