::: memo to paul cyr , quit your bumbling ramblings , the references you cite as examples are in no way personal and exemplify my dealing with the real issues so i suggest you try and analyse situations a little more efficiently rather than engaging in a witch-hunt of the innocent . do your job and go after the real personally offensive vandals with no interest in rational debate and who only serve to disrupt , not those interested in rational debate like myself . hurry along now ....

no , i specifically made the proposal as i did to get an answer to the question , how much of the time does this article spend in a vandalized or erroneous state ?. in other words , for a given interval , this article spends x% of the time being a bad source of information . ( from which one can infer that one's chances of getting bad information from it , based on a random visit , are also x% . ) : it would be interesting , i guess , to find out how many times it's been vandalized in some interval , but i think the number above would be a more useful metric . = =

i just had a look at the vandalized pages . someone created a username very close to mine , and then posted similer arguments to the ones that i was making , but did so using profanity , which you will see that i never have used . now who might have done such a thing ? i suggest looking at big . p's page . i asked him to not call those who disagree with him biatches . i cannot think of who else would have such a vandetta against me , especially because i have not used wikipedia long .

= = european plurality = = i don't think this sentence is accurate : the majority of americans descend from european immigrants who arrived after either the establishment of the first english colonies or the reconstruction period in 1863 – 1877 . this majority is expected to be reduced to only a plurality by 2050 are not most hispanics descended fully or partially from europe and speaking a european langauge ? this sounds a little like the 19th cent . argument against the italians , who are today considered white . the sentence at least needs to be more specific , that the anglo/germanic/southern europe majority will be a plurality .

:: yea , it would be on the talk page . the only reason i threw in a flair of sternness in the template was because of some of the questionable interpretations i just came across : this sonnet has suggestions of references to masturbation then , beauteous niggard , why dost thou abuse . the suggestion is that the male in the sonnet should be procreation to preserve his beauty rather than engaging in self-pleasure . . don't you love that ?
