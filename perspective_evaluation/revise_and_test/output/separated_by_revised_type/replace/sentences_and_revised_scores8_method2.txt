: there's no reason at all ; it's good science , and if the article gives the opposite impression it needs to be worked on . i did a rewrite 2-3 years ago , but i don't see much if any of my version here . but like many good scientific theories , there are those for whom their personal misinterpretation or political views cloud their understanding . sociobiology and evolutionary psychology are often associated with racism by those who can't be bothered to educate themselves about the real science behind them , and so tend to engender controversy . if i find some spare time anytime soon , i may attempt another rewrite . btw , what's up with your i s ?
