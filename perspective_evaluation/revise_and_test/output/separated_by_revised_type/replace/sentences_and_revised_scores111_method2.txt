= = background = = the background people keep reverting to , in spite of all discussion , is still absolute israeli bias . firstly the version you keep reverting to does not mention the fundamental background to the israeli-lebanese conflicts , the existence of palestinian refugees . secondly the failed to control phrase in the first sentence has connotations far too negative towards lebanon , and ignores the fact that lebanon has suffered far more greatly than israel from militancy within its borders . thirdly the background mentions that hizbollah continued to make attacks on israel after israeli withdrawal from most of lebanon ( attacks whose frequency have incidentally been greatly exaggerated ) , yet it doesn't mention that israel also carried out incursions into lebanon during this period . once again i re-iterate , it is those who keep reverting who are not respecting the neutrality of this article , and n o-o ne has has yet explained to me how i in any way am breaching wp : npov in this article by the way , yandman , are you american ? i only ask because a lot of americans are ignorant of the arab position in middle-east conflict and instictively pro-israeli , even when israel commits the most horrific war crimes , they therefore often misconstrue otherwise lucid neutrality for pro-muslim bias .

: you really picked a bad example there . murder being immoral has not in fact been a self-evident truth in all cultures or at all points in history . and , yes , in most cultures there are situations where you can be held responsible for that over which you had no control . but that's a tangent itself - the truth of those statements is irrelevant . : the section was removed as an apparent violation of wikipedia's strict policy against original research . if you can find a reputable academic study or journal article supporting that point of view , add the section back with the citation . if this is merely your own personal opinion or analysis , then it has no place in the encyclopedia . very little in this world is truly self-evident .
