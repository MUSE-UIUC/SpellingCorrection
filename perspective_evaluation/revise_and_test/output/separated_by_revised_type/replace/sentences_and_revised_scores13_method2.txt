= = = wikipedia : lgbt notice board = = = this explains a lot of the experience i've had in lgbt articles , this is used as a recruitment point to spread lgbt based propaganda . they are not the slightest bit interested in pov and get offended when you delete clearly pov and unsubstantiated , dubious content . they suggest you basically write the article from scratch for them since it's crap , because to them it's better to keep in totally incorrect propaganda then have a small article . they insist on making a million different articles covering every topic , sub-topic and sub-sub-topic on everything related to lgbt stuff ( notice the abundance of homosexuality and type articles ) , there is tons of redundant information . they're basically among the most close-minded pov pushers on wikipedia and given their persistence it's an annoying problem . the herd is noticeable on vfd pages , 4 of the 7 votes to keep the pro-feminism article , for example , came through recruited from this wikipedia notice board . 7 votes were for deletion , because clearly the article made no sense to exist ( it's all just reiterating feminist beliefs whilst repeating pro-feminist men believe ... over and over ) . without this notice board , their pov and other silly articles wouldn't stand a chance on vfd .
