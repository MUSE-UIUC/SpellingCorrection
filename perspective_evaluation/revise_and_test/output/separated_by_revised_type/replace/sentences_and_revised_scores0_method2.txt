: ed , we all have our biases , you and me both . my concern about the article is that it needs to cover a lot of bases . broadly speaking , to be fair to all parties concerned , let's acknowledge that a ) damaging quotations are a part and parcel of partisan politics , b ) there is debate about whether and when such quotations are legitimate , because c ) some can be taken out of context , while d ) different politicians exhibit different speaking styles and such styles can be the source of parody and such parodies are often based on at least some degree of truth , and e ) sometimes politicians really are dumbasses . taken in a broader context , that is how artististic political characaturists and comic impressionists make their living . did carter really smile broadly and instantly ? did ronald reagan really say well at the beginning of sentences ? where would we be without dana carvey and rich little ? obviously , this is an issue that both you and i feel strongly about . perhaps our biases just clash . maybe we need other people to delve into the articles and try to write something from a perspective that is neither yours nor mine .

the new paragraph is fine . can i convince you to switch the first and second paragraph of the 0^0 section ? first give the numerous contexts where 0^0 = 1 is the only possible definition , and the reasons , and then give the single exception where one may treat it as indeterminate , and the reason . if you want to make me perfectly happy that is ... 02:52 feb 13 , 2003 ( utc )

if you were to go to the slide that defines genetic drift at baen.tamu.edu/users/cengler/biology/notes/chapt16.ppt you would read : genetic drift is a change in allele frequency due to random variation in fecundity and mortality in a population . this seems to be exactly the point i was trying to make in the text that provoked the charge of inaccuracy . would the accuser please clarify ? 21:09 19 may 2003 ( utc )

- : the patriotic instincts of chief executive tung chee-hwa , rather than a desire to assert hong kong's separate identity , have been the main motivating factor in introduction of the bill . tung himself owes a personal debt to the prc government : his family's shipping conglomerate orient overseas was bailed out for the sum of $us120 million by chinese government-owned companies in the 1980s . removed this since this wasn't the main motivating factor . hk is constitutionally required to pass these laws .

please note that your comment that what you are saying is that you have never heard of exeter . this is your problem . perhaps you should read [ 1 ] and enlighten yourself . whatever , my point remains that the word exeter is most associated with exeter in britain , and this is the convention . is more insulting than my characterizing a tiny place of 100,000 as a jerkwater town . which it is ! i know more about british geography than 99% of americans - i remember in an online chat with some guy from sheffield that he was surprised that i knew sheffield was a city , as i was the first american he'd spoken to who had even heard of it . i think _you_ should enlighten yourself . you referred to a google search that found most of the links to the name exeter referring to the city in the uk . what proportion of those were from sites in the uk ? if you can find even _one_ site anywhere that is put up by someone outside the uk that uses exeter unqualified to refer to the one in england , and does not preface that with some reference to england , britain , or the uk ( to make it clear that he's talking about uk places ! ) i would like to see it ! july 10 , 2003

it appears under a subheading about solicitation in the confessional so it needs to be understood in that context . and while brute animals don't go into the confessional , their owners do ; it is talking about the solicitation of owners to animals to allow their animals to be used . and it doesn't talk about sodomy but sex with youths of either sex , which is different .
