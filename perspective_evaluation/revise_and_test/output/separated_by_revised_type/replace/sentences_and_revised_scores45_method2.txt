february 2006 ( utc ) : your outline looks good to me . one point though ; there's no need to separate every smallest component of a rig into an article of its own , or to have a separate article for high-speed and low-speed mals until the articles grow too big . parachuting is too big at the moment ; it should be split to several articles . however , there is no information on malfunctions at the moment so there is no justification for creating separate articles for them just yet . 08:56 , 22

sorry , i'm coming in even later . i'd suggest we follow the auckland urban area as defined in statistics nz's 2002 regional summary publication ( at least until their approach for the 2006 census becomes clear ) . this area is divided into four zones : northern , western , central and southern auckland . ( profiles of the zones , including links to maps , are listed here . ) the auckland urban area includes the hibiscus coast , kumeu , ardmore , papakura and drury , so it encompasses papakura as well as the four main city councils , and stretches beyond into the rodney and franklin districts . it does not include pukekohe , waiuku , waiheke , helensville or warkworth ( which are the other urban areas within the auckland region ) or muriwai ( which is classified as a rural centre ) .
