: hi , calpez . i really need you to back up these assertions , because as far as i can tell , none of these teams exist at all . the main problem is that none of these places are nations of any kind , so they can't possibly have national teams . just a few examples : : * australian indigenous national football team : 2 hits at google ( both wikipedia ) : * christmas island national football team : 15 hits , but only from wikipedia and wikipedia mirrors : * cocos ( keeling ) islands national football team : 5 hits . all wikipedia and wikipedia mirrors : i could go on , but i'd be wasting my time . if you want to save this section , please start looking for reliable sources to back up this information . and please bear in mind that wikipedia has a policy of no original research . you can't just claim that these teams exist because they have their own wikipedia pages . that's not how things work here .

= = jackp = raptorrobot = = i advised an admin and they didn't seem very interested . the short answer to your questions , would be yes - it'd be nice to have an admin pay attention . the difference this time seems to be that the vast majority of his edits are to certain pop culture articles - a particularly odd obsession with b-grade female film stars . and horror films . ie , apart from the odd change to canadian articles he is not being a major disruption . he loves to dab london by adding england after it ( ie , london , england ) , but will often remove australia from sydney . i spent a lot of time following his edits and reverting most of them as they were predictably poor . a minority were ok and i left them . but i soon got tired of this , particularly as he would just reinstate the changes , i had no interest in chloe seivgny or whoever ! i built a lot of evidence . but i don't know what to do , he's currently just a poor editor , not a major disruption like before
