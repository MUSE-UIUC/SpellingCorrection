i don't think this article is particularly well written . it also pushes a non-fault pov . and the use of environmental is unusual ! all that needs to be said is said already at obesity . merge what needs to be saved into that article and delete would be my suggestion .

::: the mimas article was wrong on the point of the adjectival form - it might be considered correct by some but it's not merely obscure , it's a neologism , unused anywhere except wikipedia , and most importantly , unused by astronomers , or the arbiters of astronomical nomenclature , the iau . i feel that it is inappropriate to promote the use of a neologism in an encyclopaedia , which is supposed to be descriptive rather than prescriptive , and so i have removed the reference to the word .
