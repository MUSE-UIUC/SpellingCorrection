::: well , it is fact that many authors use the term neo-paganism when talking about courtly love ( both on google and elsewhere , from what i have read ) . since the term and concept of courtly love was first popularized by gaston paris in the 1880's , and was not used before then , it may not be surprising if paris used the romantics notion of neopaganism in describing courtly love and has now become an ingrained part of the historiography . indeed , the very idea of courtly love some historians believe never existed and was a romantic 19th c idea layered on the past . i really need to re-write this article from a historians perspective , one day .

yes , i believe the article was originally called double placenames , but was then renamed list of ... somewhat confusingly , there is also a wikipedia page , category : double-named places which refers to what would more accurately be called reduplicative placenames such as pago-pago . this suggests that double is rather an ambiguous term , since various sorts of doubleness are conceivable . wouldn't amalgamated placenames be more accurate ? as for budapest , it's the notable example there of a completely merged spelling without any space . it would be good for this page to include a cities list of manageable length , let's say 10 items , but how could one define this : places with more than 100,000 inhabitants ?

= = medium pimpin & live prayer = = hi merope , i guess my article about medium pimpin is nn so i will give up . i would like to ask you about the article on live prayer however . yesterday i added a section about a number of prank calls to the show which had been made by totse members . it seems this is quite controversial and there was a lot of vandalism in the article after i added this section . now the section has been removed . why was it removed ? there was nothing wrong with it , it cited references . is wikipedia influenced by vandalism ? if enough outraged forum users vandalize wikipedia will we hide the truth ? surely isn't right . i'd add the section again , but i can't because this is a new account and i lost the password to my old account . could you perhaps add it for me ? (^_^)
