2006 ( utc ) ::::: the macrae book has a number of problems , lousy writing being the most irksome but least defective among them . heims ( strangely not yet mentioned in the further reading for this article ) is better in most respects , but incomplete as a biography . a thorough and truly complete biography of von neumann has never been written , and it is a shame . while the sentiments of friends and family members are sometimes useful in evaluating a book , they can't be counted on to be the last word . this is of course the principle strike against the goldstine book as well . ( but goldstine isn't intended to be a von neumann biography , so it doesn't even really belong in this discussion . ) 09:55 , 30 august

* hopefully this might clear up the emo debate . i found this on blender : so much so that , for ross , “ emo ” has become a dirty word . “ it’s almost an insult , ” he says . “ we’ve totally exceeded emo , which is so stagnant . not to be cocky , but those bands aren’t thinking outside the box . ”

= = origins = = the text of the article says : ... reputed to be from persia ( iran ) ... why reputed ? it's a fact . the persian cat is ubiquitous in iran and can be seen digging garbage cans for food in city alleys and streets there everywhere . theyre indigenous . in iran , the persian cat is called gorbeh yazdi ( since non-persian regular breeds also exist ) . my mother had one once when she was little in shiraz . he was named montesquieu by my grandpa . my grandma however threw the cat out back into the streets because he would pee on the persian rugs of the house . i became friends with one myself when i was a kid in isfahan once . i called her khaleh fery . she was a full size beauty . and she ate one of my turkey chicks we were raising in our backyard . but she gave birth to two lovely kittens . i tried raising them , but they had to eventually go back to the alley because my mom would not tolerate the fur balls and hair on the rugs in the house ( oh history ) . when i moved to america , i had to leave them both to tend for themselves . one kitten got run over by a car , and the other was killed by mad kids in the street , i was told later on . so it's not reputed .
