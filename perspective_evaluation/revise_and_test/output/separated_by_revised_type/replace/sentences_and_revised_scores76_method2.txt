:: what point am i trying to prove , in your imagination ? i am correcting poor writing and will continue to do so . the wording of the sentence coldplay's early material was seen as reminiscent ... is just plain bad writing , because it doesn't say who saw it as reminiscent , nor why we should give such credence to this person's opinion . if you want to insert opinions into articles , you have to specifically state whose opinions they are and defend why they're worth pushing so prominently within an article . take the matter to an admin if you don't believe me .
