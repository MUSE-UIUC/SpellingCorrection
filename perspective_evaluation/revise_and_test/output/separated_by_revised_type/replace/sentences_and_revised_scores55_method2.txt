= = vandalism on muhammad page = = perhaps that was the wrong way to deal with it , but has , along with many others from both sides ( see the history , i am vigilant about each , most of my edits are eliminating spam links such as answering islam or answering christianity ) , been essentially vandalizing this page by coming back from time to time and eliminating language that has been hammered out , if occasionally with contention , on the talk page .
