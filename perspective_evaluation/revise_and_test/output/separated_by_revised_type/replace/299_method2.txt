shit, ehit; 

for shit sakes moderators you keep deleting my contribution even though it's true , and no i'm not making it up . how do i know this ? my best friend helps to set up concert venues and has been doing that for 3 years now . when a microphone is inclosed in a concave divice or even when a hand is holding the part you speak in , it creates a loop for the sound thus causing minor feedback . sometimes it comes in the form of echoing distortions and other times it comes in the form of howling and screaching . so moderators and those who keep deleting my contributions , for shit sakes .
