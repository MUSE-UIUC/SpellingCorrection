i don't condone insulting america , even if what htey say is true , just for our benefit . canada's cities suffer from many of the same issues as most large american cities ( pollution , traffic , crime , unemployment , homelessness ) , and we can't and should not say ha ha ! we're better than you because we don't have , and you do ! , since most cities have them . i don't try to bash my city or say it's a bad place , and contrary to how i feel , the city actually has been getting better in recent years ( 2003-now ) , despite crime rates increasing somewhat . homelessness is down slightly , violent crime was down right up until our first-ever cop killing ... our main problems are unemployment and petty theft/small crimes like robbery . our rape level is low , as is our murder rape . windsor's main issues for crime are assaults , threats , and burglary/ break-and-enter ( b&e ;) . now , one might get confused when they say but coonfox , you just said it has the highest crime rate ! true , we do per capita . we have more break-and-enters and convenience store robberies than any other city in canada when adjusted to population . overall , though , toronto , ontario and metro detroit still beat us , since they have around 4 million people each ( 20x our population ) . and yes , only rouyn-noranda , quebec/val-d'or , quebec ( #1 ) and sudbury , ontario ( #2 ) beat windsor for unemployment . times are tough for everyone right now . that's just my $c 0.02 . -
