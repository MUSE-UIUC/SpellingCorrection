:: sorry , i think you misunderstand me . an ndash is preferred , but what you did was replace what was already visible as an ndash (–) with html code which results in the same thing , but looks more confusing in the wikitext , and wasn't necessary in the first place , since it was already an ndash , rather than a regular short dash . (–= – vs . - , if you see what i mean ) again , not a big deal , just silly to replace something which shows up the same with something which is confusing to more people .

* why would anyone use a noise weighting curve to assess hearing damage ? that would indeed be stupid , as there is no reason at all to suppose that there is any correlation between apparent loudness and damage . i stick to my argument that 468 is the only curve actually designed for noise assessment , for reasons given , and that a-weighting is very wrong for the job ( it doesn't even have a proper hf rolloff anything like that of the equal-loudness contours ) . assessing music is something yet again , and since it is sometimes noise-like and sometimes pure tones it really needs something more complex than a weighting curve , based on proper combination of the outputs of a bank of narrow band filter .
