= = = = = the wikipedia article on federal vision shows a strong flavor of bias , because it does not clearly describe federal vision's distinctive , and often contested , meanings for various christian theological words and phrases of long standing ; and because it omits an adequately clear summary of the most common criticisms of fv . the neutrality of the article can be strengthened in at least two ways . one way is clarify the new definitions that certain federal visionists have created for certain established theological terms and phrases . for example , the federal vision's view of covenant objectivity results in a category of person some have called the unbelieving christian or unsaved christian , which most evangelicals regard as an oxymoronic statement . federal visionists assert a belief in election , but subdivide the elect between elect who are granted an additional grace of perseverance and thus persevere in their faith unto eternal life , as opposed to a different category of the elect who are not granted a special grace of perseverance by god , and as a result apostasize from the christian faith and are eternally condemned to hell . the phrase obedient faith has been adopted from controversial crc pastor rev . norman shepherd , and is used to signify that one is justified not by faith alone ( that is , faith in jesus christ and the gospel , considered apart from its subjective ethical influences ) , but by the consequent actions of ethical obedience to god's will which result from faith . this brings us to a second way to make the wikipedia article neutral , which is to add a clear section on basic criticisms of federal vision . the link section addresses some of these , but there ought to be material in the body of the article itself that enumerates and clearly describes the most common criticisms of federal vision . e.g. , federal vision has been criticized as not being properly described as evangelical ( since evangelical denotes a protestant insistence on the necessity of individual conversion ) , in light of its teaching of presumptive baptismal regeneration , and continual criticism ( and sometimes mockery ) of american evangelicalism's emphasis on the encessity of conversion . in this sense , it appears to be more akin to high anglicanism , which is non-evangelical . the claim that it more faithfully represents the thought of john calvin is disputed by many familiar with calvin's theology .

= = gita's samkhya is not different = = only the ignorant speak of devotional service [ karma-yoga ] as being different from the analytical study of the material world [ sankhya ] . those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths achieves the results of both . ( gita 5.4 ) you are not a hindu and so you would not know this . do you have any proof at all that this sankhya is different ? why would sri krishna say this if it were different . he would have said so ! sri krishna in the gita ( 10.26 ) of all trees i am the banyan tree , and of the sages among the demigods i am narada . of the gandharvas i am citraratha , and among perfected beings i am the sage kapila . i am also going to post these quotes into the main article to clear up any confusion .

: mystar , thanks for the comment . edit wars have made me revert to working mainly on that article lately . wikipedia needs to do more so that articles evolve rather than devolve and so that it's a better process . the memorial day article provides a good example where little unverified stuff gets put in and good stuff edited out . : which sections in the killed in action ( kia ) article do you mean ? we do also use the talk page there a lot .

= = king air article = = bill , sorry for not responding sooner to your question about the military versions of the 90 , and the general length of the article . i've been mulling it over , and i'm still not sure what would be best , but i'm wondering about splitting the article into one about the 90/100 series and another about the 200/300 series . that , to me , is where the logical split is , in a number of ways . the 200/300 ( including 350 ) , went by super king air , and while there's a lot of commonality between the 90 and 100 , there's much less so between the 100 and 200 ( the exception would be the 90f which borrowed the 200's tail , but i wouldn't worry about that ) . plus , the pt-6a engine comes in two families , the large pt6a and the small pt6a (# of pt wheels being a big factor ) . the 90/100 kas use small pt6s , the 200/300 use large pt6s , so there's a natural split there . if we split the article there , each would have a fairly decent length , and could possibly be split further down the road if they continued to grow . just some thoughts ....

starting with the 6.0 litre to the current 7.3 litre developed from the engine used in the sl65 amg . i'm not 100% sure about this . but i am pretty sure the engine is not from the sl65 , which uses twin turbos . i believe the engine is the same as in a 2002 s600 . the older , non-turbo v12s . i believe they bored it out and kept in normally aspirated on all pagani models .
