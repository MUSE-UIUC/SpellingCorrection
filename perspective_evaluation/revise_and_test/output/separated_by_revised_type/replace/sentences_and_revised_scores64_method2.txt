please revert them back until we can have a larger group discussion on this particular topic . i am a current second-year student and tour guide at the school and i can verify that we are instructed to talk about all of the aforementioned traditions that you wrongfully removed . if you do not attend the school or are affiliated with it , i see no reason for you to take down the hard work of others without further group discussion . that constitutes vandalism .

** opie , your statement you don't honestly believe that the author of the golf tee book is making things up …. is foolish . many books and authors present fraudulent and construed information . some of these authors print information that is researched haphazardly and sometimes not researched at all . this is why reputable authors research and verify the content they use with agencies that hold the fact-based and documented information . you consistently use the book the singular history of the golf tee by irwin r . valenta , along with the website “ scottish golf history ” as a fact-based source . looking at the website alone i find an abundance of erroneous and inaccurate information and patents . one just for example , is the u.s. patent of mr. dalziel in 1896 . this patent , is claimed on the site as a “ golf tee , ” but in actuality is a device to be used in a game of tennis and has no relation or bearing on the game of golf . see patent #567 , 455 this is just one of the flagrant inaccuracies that are included in the links and information you have provided . another example of a site that has inaccurate information is pat ryan golf timeline . it states that the bloxsom & douglas patent originated in 1899 . whether these “ inaccuracies ” are intentional or not , it is the lack of due diligence of the authors and originators that seems to be the issue . once corrected information has been verified and deemed accurate , upon the notification to the necessary parties , the erroneous information should be removed . if it is not , then one is lead to believe that the misinformation by the author or originator is intentional . all of the u.s. patents can be verified through the u.s. patent office website . however , you say that the uk office has patents that are unsearchable through their website . it seems very suspicious that all of the patents that are quoted in the book seem to be “ unavailable ” through the uk patent office website for verification .
