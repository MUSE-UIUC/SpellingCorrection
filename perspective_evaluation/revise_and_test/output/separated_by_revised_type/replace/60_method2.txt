dude , let's not be silly . i wholeheartedly doubt that black people are afraid of a mulatto uprising . i think black people are more afraid if not most afraid of not progressing due to perceived racism ( real or not ) by whites who have the real power . besides , there have been plenty of mulatto ( those people who phenotypically have kind of a beige skin color , and caucasian features ) uprisings against darker skinned people be they in north africa or western usa or south america . actually , these people whether they be mestizos , mulattos , dark caucasians are already racist towards darker skinned people , which most of the time includes black people and native indians - ie , the systemic racism is already there . there isn't going to be some sort of big bang uprising wherein mulattos start to uprise against darker skinned people or black people . the concept of black and mulatto aren't diametrically oppossed like the concepts of black and white . the worst thing that can happen is balkanization . furthermore , as white people continue to identify as white , i don't see the idea of blackness going anywhere soon .
