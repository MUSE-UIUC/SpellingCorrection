: no user sanam 001 , yoou have not answered to my questions before , you are a liar . first answer this question : you stated that a kshatriya is simply a varna-rank and this sanskrit terminology confering legitimate claims to rulership can only be used to define members provided they practice specific rules of conduct ( dharma ) and importantly adhere to a personal life following all sixteen consecrations or tenets ( shodasha samskaram ) while simultaneously being recognized/legitimized by the regulators of moral-codes ( brahmanas/priests ) based on their jurisprudence of consideration of suitability ; the pb is that in old hindu texts greeks , persians , chinese (...) were called kshatriyas whereas they were not hindu , did not speak sanskrit and brahmins were not their priests ... there is a big big contradiction between what you wrote and this fact ... tell me why ???... why ???... why ???...
