thank you , that's very kind of you . i reached my boiling point yesterday and completely blew up . it was quite a lot of fun , really . kelly martin needs to be brought down to size , imho . also , he apparently doesn't know as much relevant law as i do , even if he did attend two years of law school . what i left on his user page was not a specific threat aimed at him . hell , it wasn't even a threat . it was a description of my feelings . also he apparently lives in chicago , and i live in southern west virginia . threats across state lines are almost never followed up . cops have better things to do . i could have told him i actually wanted to kill him , and the police still would not do anything . except offer a totally useless restraining order . i guess i have the practical knowledge he lacks . and if they did something , which is about as likely as me winning the next powerball ? i'd just be placed in a mental hospital on a 72 hour hold , and that ain't no thang ! i chuckle , however , at the thought of a dishevelled cross dresser shambling into a police station reeking of bo and mad dog , lubriderm and semen , and saying that someone threated to kill him . i think the police wouldn't have a problem imagining why someone might want to do that .

:: emancipation ( 1862 ) was closely tied to growing power of abolitionists as mcpherson says : ::: by the beginning of 1862 the impetus of war had evolved three shifting and overlapping republican factions on the slavery question . the most dynamic and clearcut faction were the radicals , who accepted the abolitionist argument that emancipation could be achieved by exercise of the belligerent power to confiscate enemy property . on the other wing of the party a smaller number of conservatives hoped for the ultimate demise of bondage but preferred to see this happen by the voluntary action of slave states coupled with colonization abroad of the freed slaves . in the middle were the moderates , led by lincoln , who shared the radicals ' moral aversion to slavery but feared the racial consequences of wholesale emancipation . events during the first half of 1862 pushed moderates toward the radical position . one sign of this development was the growing influence of abolitionists . never has there been a time when abolitionists were as much respected , as at present , rejoiced one of them in december 1861 .

arachibutyrophobia = = i submit that this is not a fictional phobia . while mentioning it in a conversation in 1988 , i met a long-time sufferer . as a child , when her family first came to america from russia , she found a jar of peanut butter in the refrigerator of the person with whom they were staying . it was something she had only read about , but never tasted . she dug out a big spoonful , put the whole thing in her mouth , and nearly asphyxiated ! ( cold peanut butter is particularly sticky . ) since then , i have heard similar tales of childhood trauma from choking experiences . as adults , even the smell of peanut butter can trigger a severe anxiety attack . see changethatsrightnow.com for details . yes , virginia , some people are deathly afraid of peanut butter ... and with good reason , too ! = =
