maybe if you make some more chauvinist edits and statements like the last ones and this one , the others here will finally understand , what kind of hungarian user we have here . the article contains pure facts , it could not be more neutral than it is .

= = list of products in the simpsons = = hello george . i see you've been actively making additions to list of products in the simpsons . it is good that you're enthusiastic about the list . however , i would like to suggest that you might be going a bit overboard . there are literally thousands of products and stores in the simpsons that are seeing in single shots as throwaway jokes , etc . if one were to list them all , the list would be fairly bulky and useless ( this has happened on other simpsons lists already and have had to be cut back ) . i'd like to suggest the following guidelines : * stores aren't products , so i would suggest you not list stores such as herman's military antiques . * bulk groups of products like the many antiques at herman's military antiques . * do not include real-world products like english muffins . if you do that , it's pointless . everything in the house is a product . tvs , couches , drapes , carpet , etc . besides which , i would argue that noone in the world would ever need to look up whether english muffins are sold on the simpsons . real world products are assumed to exist on the show since it is rarely shown otherwise . the list should really be for simpsons-invented brand-names or invented products . the next issue is subjective , but i believe crucial to keeping the list from spiraling out of control : products on the list should only be included if they are used more than once on the show . throwaway jokes like itchy & scratchy land personalised license plates are basically just describing a joke on the show . the list is really designed more for things like laramie cigarettes , squishys and things that make up the simpsons lore than a list of throwaway jokes . that doesn't mean some of your edits aren't perfect for the list ; i believe you added radioactive man comics , the springfield shopper and li'l bastard kits . these are great ones , but things like disemboweller iv needn't be included . i am going to be deleting some of the ones that fall into the bullet point list above ( real-world items and bulk groups ) but i'm not going to immediately delete single-appearance items , but i suggest you join a discussion at wikipedia talk : wikiproject the simpsons #list of products in the simpsons . thanks )
