i must admit , that first paragraph is oodles more interesting , but it's totally fruity . or is it nutty ? whatever the case , it smacks of granola . ( i hope you can take that with a sense of humor . ) all i want is for the article to be specific and comprehensible . bfi'm not talking about presenting lots of different points of view , i'm just saying that to describe new age we can't use new age language , because you get trapped in a circle of self-reference . i know that you may feel that traditional forms of language don't properly express the sense of new age , but the trick is to start from a common foundation , then build towards the vision , not start from the vision . the rapture of instant enlightenment can't ( shouldn't ? ) come from an encyclopedia ; rather , it may complement and guide the experience . thecunctator

article says : : a cantor , more properly known as a hazzan , has no formal role in jewish law . and then it says : : traditional jewish law restricts hazzanim to be males over the age of 13 ; the non-orthodox jewish movements allow women over the age of 12 to be hazzans as well . if the hazzan has no formal role in halakha , how is it that halakha sets requirements to be one ? sjk
