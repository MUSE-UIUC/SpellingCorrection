:: why was demause's comment copied into the article ? it refers to assertions made on this talk page , not to the article ( or perhaps to some old version of the article ? ) , and is in no way a famous quote or a quote that especially characterizes his work , so it doesn't belong there . and where's that pedophilia misquote he refers to ?
