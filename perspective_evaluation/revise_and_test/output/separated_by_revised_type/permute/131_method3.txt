a question for ejf why is it you persist in deleting my delete on the page about nothing . for a page to be about nothing it must have nothing on it or it is about something . now if you're going to be that much of a boring old git about it perhaps you should spend your time trying to make somebody elses world a little less fun or do you enjoy making things more boring than they could be ?
