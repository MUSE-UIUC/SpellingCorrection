climate ? please ! what idiot suggested russell , kansas has a humid subtropical climate ? there is no way in hell russell , kansas could be classified as humid subtropical . it is either humid continental or semi-arid steppe , and i would lean toward the latter , since this part of kansas is not nearly as humid and does not receive near the rainfall as the eastern half of the state . if kansas citywhich is at the same latitude as russellis classified as humid continental , there is no earthly reason why russell , which is nearly five derees farther west in longitude can be humid subtropical .
