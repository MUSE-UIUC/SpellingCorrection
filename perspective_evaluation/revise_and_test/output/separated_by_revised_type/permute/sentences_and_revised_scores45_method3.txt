= = speedy deletion request = = if everyone who posted racist comments online was a notable figure wikipedia would be full of this info . there is no claim to notability for this individual . the article seems like a way to expose the individual or punish him for being racist . as far as the information on the individual's actions , the article only states that the individual was a prolific poster of racist material on a racist forum and attracted some unwanted attention in the form of quasi-legal action by a lawyer . the article is a good candidate for speedy deletion .

the criteria for ga - as opposed to fa - are simply * be well written * be factually accurate * use a neutral point of view * be stable * be referenced , and * wherever possible , contain images to illustrate it . * good articles may not be as thorough and detailed as our featured articles , but should not omit any major facets of the topic . someone obviously feels that this article meets these criteria . for you to dismiss it out of hand , for reasons that are not required for ga status , and are in fact addressed by the article anyway , and not attempt to make modifications yourself either , is not on . cultural context is 1980s popular children's/teen comics derived from cartoons designed to sell plastic toys . legacy is the new dh3 series . influences are the transformers series . writers are simon furman , and dan abnett . this is all quite clear in the article .
