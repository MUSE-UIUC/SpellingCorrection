a mile is larger than a kilometer . infact a mile is approximately equal to 1.6 kilometers . so , a square mile is larger than a square kilometer . obviously there should be more people in the larger unit of area . but according to the existing entry 1,301 . 8 people in a square kilometer ( which is the smaller unit ) and and 502.6 in a square mile ( which is the larger unit ) .

thats not very nice for the people of san roque ... i personally know quite a few people from this town . san roque has a place in wikipedia just as any other town does . perhaps you would like to delete the whole article ? i see your hispanophobia is slowly being brought to the surface . by the way , gibraltar was just another town in the southern coast of spain until the british conquest . why write its history before that moment ? since before the british it was so unremarkable is there any point , according to your own logic , to grant it a history of its own ?

( est 1770 , chart . 1785 ) . the medical school which became u of l has operated continously since 1837 , but i'm not sure when we became officially municipally funded . a google search usually brings up the louisville municipal college for negros , which was purchased by u of l ; so i may have email someone to find out brando03

are you even reading what i write ? read bournatian one more time , this time more carefuly , he speifically covers the preiod which i was talking about , he also is the one providing the data of the armenian emigration from erivan region from 1795 to 1827 , he document the desertion and the armenian refugees in his works . he does not contradict what i am saying . and you new data , well , again , you are not reading me , i do not disagree about this , it was those years that julfa was destroyed and its armenian population deported this is also documented , the armenians will later , during the ottoman partial controls where nakhichevan will be used as a storing place for the marchandises from india etc , recolonise that region and rebuild julfa . i already contended that during the mongol invasion the armenian population dropped . what on the other hand i said was that pre abbas in the 17th century just before the deportation , armenians were there constituting a majority , and i have provided various works that equal the population to armenian and i have also provided another work which you author you claim has not much knowledge . we are not talking about the same period at all . while i recognize every periods when muslim have constituted a majority , with obstinence you refuse to listen as if azerbaijan will lose nakhichevan just because i wrote that and that you accepted it . give yourself a brake grandmaster , we are debating about this whole affair because of a simple word , just like your obstinence about the term enclave which you wanted to remove .
