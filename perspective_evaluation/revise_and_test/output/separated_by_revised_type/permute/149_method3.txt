op-eds are worthless sources when they don't work for chriso's narrative ; must-reads which establish the fact of the matter when they do work for chriso's narrative . court-appointed forensic ballistics experts are fringe kooks also . side note , i actually added text which stated discretly that the libel conviction had been overturned by a higher court , but that was rv'd . the operative definition here for npov violation , after all is not chriso's pov .
