* when an article is on the front page ( dyk ) it attracts a lot of attention . i am sure circeus wants what almost all editors want , to make wikipedia as good an encyclopedia as possible . remember this is an enyclopedia that anyone can edit ( and will ) . we are to assume good faith by policy , and there are warnings against both ' owning ' an article and calling other users names ( at least repeatedly ) . always try to talk things out on talk pages . * more soon on uploading pictures - the quickest way would be to upload it here for now ( on wikipedia ) and if you want i could upload it to commons . if you want i can also walk you through commons . take care ,

your sources relying on this article are far left fringe sites . only original articles should be linked from credible sources . that said regardless of the amount of help provided iraq it's not against the law to support one side over the other when iran was openly hostile to the us and started that path of their own volition . i'm part of the wikimilitary history project and so i will not let your biased reportage and allegations stand . it is heavily skewed in favor of a victimized iran . this is a false impression and an appeal to emotion by a partisan . that's not what we do here . it is npov . i will revert until hell freezes over and someone of authority steps in to stop you . it will happen .

yes , indeed , this has been an on-going personality conflict that started long before wikipedia was even created . thebee has , in my view , been quite busy harassing me , following me around and starting discussions on most of the article talk pages and several user talk pages , including my own , for the sole purpose of chastising me . here are some examples of his harassment tactics : he has brought this same discussion to many administrators , using the same diffs - trying to get me banned from wikipedia .

: i see your point , thanks for making it clear . but the exception or living/dead issue you are talking about is not mentioned in the promophoto tag itself and i still think that your actual problem should firstly be with that tag , rather than the images using it . you see , there are many people complaining on your talk page saying the images uploaded by them are not easily recreatable and believing the images fit the description in the tag . you could perhaps discuss the problem on that tag's talk page or on wikipedia : fair use ( if you already haven't , of course ) . perhaps a rewording of the tag could be agreed upon and prevent interpretations like mine and other complaining guys ' from occuring in the future . i still maintain that any publicity photo released by , say , a record company to be used on media for the promotion of one of their artists could also be usable here on wikipedia like they are used everywhere else and this category of images won't pose a restriction on wikipedia's redistributabilty . regards ,
