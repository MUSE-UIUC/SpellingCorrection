loathing is an appropriate response to a rape scene . the american audience is too used to seeing rape exploited simply as a plot point in an entertainment , so it's refreshingif disturbingto see a rape scene portrayed as horrifically as it is in showgirls . see i spit on your grave for another example of a film that makes it abundantly clear that the rape scene is not intended for entertainment . as brutal as the rape scenes are in these movies , it's clear that both of them are anti-rape movies . so the scene has fulfilled its purpose . ( frankly , i'm a bit repulsed when someone suggests that the rape scene in showgirls should somehow be softened . )
