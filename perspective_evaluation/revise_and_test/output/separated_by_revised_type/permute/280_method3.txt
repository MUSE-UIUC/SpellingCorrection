( utc ) every second year the falcon is going to be replaced . it's a difficult situation because ford motor company australia is the last australian designed and manufactured company that isn't working on the base chassis and running gear that fomoco usa is putting out . truth be told , the ford falcon is the only remaining australian car ( which i didn't see mentioned in the article , i'll address this in a sub thread ) . however , op is correct . the ea and ea 30th anniversary model and mk ii were possibly one of the most reliable of ford falcon's releases , the fuckers used to push up to 600,000 on the odo before engine parts started to fail . many taxi used variants rolled the clock over , i remember seeing a mates hit the big 0's on all original parts , and owned a 30th as my first car . that being said , the taurus would never compete , it's too expensive and too shit . fomoco au left the ef in the microwave a bit too long and it resulted in au's . some of those were washed with cold water and shrunk into what they termed the taurus . 00:49 , 9 december 2011
