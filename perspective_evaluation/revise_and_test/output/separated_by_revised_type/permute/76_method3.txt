hello ! i am the one who keeps insisting on making the god damn entry . my entry has become long winded based on your ( both of yours , actually ) insistance that my entry is non-factual . i have cited a dictionary entry based solely on your statement that the word damn does not mean to be condemned by god , when , in fact it does . as an atheist , you can rest assured that i am not offended by this phrase . who the fuck are you to determine that because you can't figure out the definition of a word when it is provided to you , that my entry is incorrect ? the fact that you retracted or edited my entry 3 times does not make it incorrect . it means that you have been an idiot 3 times . you are the one guilty of vandalizing my entry by removing it without a valid reason . the fact that you have relatives that do not like the term god damn for religious reasons is not relevent to this topic , and your argument concerning the entymology is fallacious . does any ever say steve damn or that stupid fuck smccandlish damn ? no , they do not , beacuse to the followers of modern mythology ( i.e. christianity ) , the only thing capable of damning is god , hence the phrase god damn is redundant .
