:: i don't think he has a call to arms over every disagreement he is in ( given his large editing circle im sure he has many ) . he has only tended to inform large groups of people when he knew they were interested in an important decission to be made by wikipedians as he knew they would have an opinion and would want the chance to air it . as such , i support him in those efforts , especially as i appreciate to be informed of impending decissions .

: well , the article really only attacked one factual problem ( or rather factual controversy not mentioned : uncertainty of his year of birth , which i sort of addressed , but should probably be mentioned specifically ( oh yeah , the years he was sec . of treasury too , i think ; i didn't address that )) , and was more of an attack on style and grammar . i did a pretty quick proofread and edit of the article , and there were some pretty egregious grammar , punctuation , captialization , and punctuation problems . others should probably do the same ; my repair was rather cursory . -

the answer to your specific question about 働 hataraku is a no also . the onyomi was based on the right half of the character which is chinese . chinese 勞動 vs japanese 労働 . the japanese character 働 is never used in chinese . do a search in google and specify this character and restrict the result to chinese pages only . you will some webpages using this character , but they are mostly japanese pages mislabeled as chinese pages . they are some chinese pages using this character in the context of referring to the japanese labor ministry . i don't count that as reverse importation . imho , the statement in the article about reverse importation is incorrect .
