:: nice wording there . that's the point . it's a fact . it's not a portrayal that is too positive . it's a fucking fact . what planet is this ? where does this argument come from ? it is a fact . it matters not what editors of this encyclopedia think . it matters greatly what the sources state . and they state it explicitly : michael jordan is the greatest basketball player of all-time , by acclamation michael jordan is the greatest basketball player of all-time . how much more explicit do you expect it to get ? they aren't going to waltz the answer out to you . this is an objective look at someone who demonstrably showed that they were the greatest . if editing is a problem , then just create a special lock or something for the opening paragraph that only the top moderators can unlock . every source in existence acknowledges him as #1 all-time . so the idea of having certain wording that may not object to certain users ' opinions completely defeats the purpose of an encyclopedia .
