things you should know about wikipedia * there's always people who are going to take an overactive interest in your talk page and change it to fit what they want it to say ... these people have no life . * some administrators will lecture you as if you're their own kid ... ignore them ... that's what i do . * saying somebody has a hard on for your talk page can get you blocked . but when other people come to your defense in the situation ... you really only end up being blocked for 15 minutes .

. i appreciate you raising the issue but it may be worth looking at the background of the person before you complain that they are being disrespectful to a flag . you asked me to imagine if someone did that to a flag of my own country when the crossed flag was of a entity to which my country belongs . you could find that out quite easily from the other userboxes on my page ( esp . the one saying i'm from the uk ) and by looking up the members of the eu , who's flag was the one crossed on my page

, 7 march 2006 ( utc ) :::::: yes , i'm sure it's possible that the many books and articles on the topic , written by various well-known authors , or found in reputable sources , are , in fact , completely wrong , but you'd have to find other reputable sources to refute them ; your own personal concern with the concept is not particularly relevant . regarding the definition , it's pretty much the same as it was 3 months ago , and the forumulation which presents it more as perception than fact is in deference both to npov , and to various editors ( like yourself ) who were opposed to the concept that it existed at all . finally , the photograph does not really illustrate the concept well ; a far better one would be the rather common star of david = swastika signs you say at various rallies . 17:53
