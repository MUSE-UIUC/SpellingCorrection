dcokeman , while you preach to us from up high on what neutrality means , you need to take a lesson in civility . * stop throwing out lame definitions from webster's dictionary to prove your point , maybe assume we know a little bit about the english language . * stop preaching to us what neutrality means like a father talks to a child , just make your point about why something is neutral or not without defining neutrality for us everytime . assume we're maybe quite possibly smarter than monkeys . * don't shout , there's no reason why you need to shove your opinion down our throats .
