maybe you could try and get your message across without all capitals and without swear words ( or calling slimvirgin a jerk and an asshole etc etc ) . keeping it civil will give you a slightly better chance of getting your message across . i thought saying f**% ! ng was at least a slight improvement over having all the letters . maybe not .

dcokeman , while you preach to us from up high on what neutrality means , you need to take a lesson in civility . * stop throwing out lame definitions from webster's dictionary to prove your point , maybe assume we know a little bit about the english language . * stop preaching to us what neutrality means like a father talks to a child , just make your point about why something is neutral or not without defining neutrality for us everytime . assume we're maybe quite possibly smarter than monkeys . * don't shout , there's no reason why you need to shove your opinion down our throats .
