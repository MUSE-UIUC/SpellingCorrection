::: ??? in what way is saying its useful an npov issue ?? if someone uses this for something , then its useful . in my case , i am reading an article on markov logic networks , wherein linguistic reification is one of the early steps , followed by conversion to a lambda calculus form , and then many other steps . in this calculation , reification is a crucial step . the natural stupidity article cited probably just says that using reified forms ( aka qlf's or quasi-logical forms ) in certain ways is stupid ; it cannot claim that qlf's in and of themsels are useless .
