you're wrong ; iar applies to admins and regular editors alike . you have provided no evidence of that . as i said , i have the facts and you guys just have bullshit . what is a regular editor ? i am not a regular editor i am an occasional editor . the ignore all rules rule does not mean there can be one set of rule exceptions for you and another set of rule exceptions for me . we can agree on an exception to the rules , but the exception must apply equally to both of us . for example , we could agree that it is ok here to break the wikipedia rule against using personal blogs as sources . but that would mean that links to my blog must be allowed here and could not be excluded by arbitrary , discriminatory distinctions between crappy personal blogs and reputable personal blogs . as fatheaded ed brayton would say , you are full of batshit wingnuttery .
