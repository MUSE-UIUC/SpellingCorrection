allen3 : fyi , here is one religious organisation's viewpoint on how animals should be treated . this is from the catechism of the catholic church , ( i hope this link works : ( http://www.vatican.va/archive/eng0015/_p8b.htm#lz ) . look near bottom of page re 7th commandment . it is the church's view of our responsibilities towards animals . what makes it noteworthy is that it actually represents the views and approach of billions of people , unbeknownst to themselves , who somehow get through life treating animals in amaner consistent with this belief system without feeling any guilt whatsoever for believeing that animals have nothing but the right to be tasty . they probably never even knew a written position existsed ! this verifiable link is but one source that exists ; other religious organisations too issue clearly enunciate viewpoints . good luck getting them convincing vegan , bunny-luvin gate-guarders that these types of viewpoints are entrenched , widespread and valid .

i'm confused here . in 1995 , portraits of past was considered a hardcore band/ emo /etc . yet the people who created this page claim that modern screamo bands have no connection to hardcore even if these screamo bands are playing music that is identical to the mid 90s emo/hardcore sound ? pg 99 steals so much from pop style . all of this lacks a consistent logic and denies history . it's just as bad as pop-punk and indie rock being tied to the history of the emo/hardcore scene of the 90s . if some of you bother to go through your back issues of hac , you'll see the term's sparing use as nothing more than hyperbole . chaotic hardcore indeed . need we not forget that orchid wasn't doing anything that uranus , drift , and one eyed god prophecy was doing years before ? this is just sad .
