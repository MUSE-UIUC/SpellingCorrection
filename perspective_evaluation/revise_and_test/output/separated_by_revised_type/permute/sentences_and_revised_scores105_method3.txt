please respond , and not defensively , here . no sane person would look at what you do , day and night , day after day , week after week , month after month , year after year and not conclude that you need a massive intervention . i have to think you are a very lonely , unhappy person , so no one probably knows of the depth of your sickness . so it falls to a stranger like me , i guess . you are so engrossed that i can't envision you just admitting what has become of you , but i am willing to start to introduce you to reality . let's start with this question : how many hours of your short life have your poured into this wasted foolishness at the expense of actually living a life ?
