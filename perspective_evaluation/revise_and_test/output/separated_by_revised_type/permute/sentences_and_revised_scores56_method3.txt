= = that austin allegro pic = = i think the pic of a 1979 austin allegro is actually a vanden plas either 1500 or 1750 model . you can tell by the raised grille attached to the bonnet - the vp was a luxury ( sic ) version of the allegro mark 2 model produced between 1975 and 1979 . it had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats , and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic . the vp was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate allegros with luxury motoring ? it was probably produced because ford was having big success with the ghia versions of some of its models , upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged , and cash-strapped bl was desperate for some of the action . the reason for raising this is that vps weren't actually badged as austins ( or allegros for that matter ) , but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same bl dealderships , so the pic shouldn't appear on the austin history page cos it isn't . pedantic big mike
