i think the article needs a defense echo . there are no serious countermovements yet for two main reasons . the first is that this would only add energy to the movement . right now , media blackout regarding the topic is working better than arguing . the second is that there are no real strong defenses against most of the rationales to impeach . if the media were not controlled , impeachment would have taken place allready . the publics ignorance is the only way that impeachment is forestalled . there are no cogent or valid counterarguments for most of the reasons to impeach .
