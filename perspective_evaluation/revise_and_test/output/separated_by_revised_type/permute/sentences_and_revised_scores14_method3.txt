: the difference in perspective is in your saying that you are baffled by the link between terrorism and iraq but no in the next say there was no significant link between iraq and al qaeda . so you imply that terrorism = al queda . i would say that iraq was one of the links in the chain or terrorism , which is supported not simply by usama pulling strings in afghanistan , but by a network of recruiters , trainers , financiers and sympathizers . for a variety of reasons iraq was a central link in this chain . perhaps i could put it this way . when japan attacked pearl harbor , the u.s. went to war with japan , but it also went to war with germany and italy . hitler didn't attack the u.s. ; mussolini didn't attack the u.s. bu that they were japan's allies , half a world away , was enough . | 7 july 2005 16:18 ( utc )

= = beer ? = = hi matthew , i'm in london july 25 to august 4 . i think we should have our annual beer . incidentally i'm in finland at the moment attending debconf5 . the travel advice suggested a cheap way of getting to helsinki is to fly to estonia and take the short ferry trip across the water . but then i thought i'm probably on some estonian customs black list . the prospect of a strip search by enthusiastic friends of he who does not want to be identified as an estonian customs officer made me think again : i flew direct . imagine : by wikipedia rules if they missed the four opportunities ( in and out , in and out ) they could catch up with me 10 months later . yes , i know , the logic escapes me too .

well of course they do , but not like vampire bats or count dracula . they are known to be somewhat ferocious , and make a lot of noise , which could lead to someone believing they are like the tasmanian devil . they feed on smaller animals and make a racket and a mess when killing them . but they aren't some sort of bloodthirsty freaks . your jackass friend is somewhat correct because blood is part of any carnivore's intake . but fishers aren't bloodthirsty or do it for pleasure .

also etymology of khorasan doesn't mean land of the sun it means the place [ where ] the sun comes from . and only parts of today's afghanistan where part of the old khorasan province . why do you insist on inclusion your misinformation when you are clueless on a subject ? besides , what are you trying to achieve by including this wrong information in this article ? who benefits from it and in what form ?
