because the image is misleading and it is completely biased . this is an encylcopedia - it has to be fair . so let's change the setting a little bit . if we had no photos of the twin towers collapsing on 9/11 , should we put a picture up of the us in afghanistan . to someone who was not fully aware about the conflict , they would assume that the conflict is about the americans attacking afghanistan . the pictures need to be as neutral and fair as possible . because the average joe does not read everything . and don't hold a double standard against israel .

= = crux links = = i'm really starting to get tired of your personal vendetta against me . it's not spamming because : 1 . the link is not commercial , i.e. it provides no services for any fees , therefore it also 2 . cannot be advertising . i added links to the crux on pages such as the greco-persian conflict , ezra , nehemaiah , and artaxerxes because there are specific chapters in the book that present a very interesting historical analysis of those particular topics , with specific reference to the history of the class conflict between the jewish people and the greeks and romans around the time of the 1st century . what on earth is spam about that ? the only true guidelines about adding external links are that they cannot be the person's own website , they cannot be commercial links , and the amount of one particular viepoint should not dominate if that viewpoint is out of the mainstream . i have broken none of those rules .
