: well given that the date of the newspaper pre-dates the supposed death , unless reports of his death were greatly exaggerated , which seems unlikely , i suspect that the various other sources might have picked up the date of his funeral by mistake .

= = grafitti & defacement ? = = i reedited the page to make the section about the graffiti more neutral ( though now it is probably leaning more the other way ) . i vehemently disagree that the graffiti was defacing anything . the first level was more just crap really , but walking up the stairs there were some great paintings . and yes , paintings . i went back a 3rd time with a friend and was crushed when i saw the walls were all white . but on that topic , when i was there , there were workers in apartment #50 , and with my limited russian confidence at the time i got something out of them about a museum , but they very well could have just been lying so there wasn't a riot , or fed up with people asking them . has anybody been there recently ? ( or since i was in apr 2003 ? ) i'd love to know what has happened to the place , whether there is a museum or if there is more horrible graffiti defacing the walls .
