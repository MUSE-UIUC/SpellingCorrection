i've addressed every citation needed tag save one ( concerning flashbacks and ptsd ) . there probably remain several statements which need footnoting . concerns raised on far include the following : * prune external links , which has become quite the untidy link farm , as well as the see also section . * convert citations to proper format , including pmids for medical journal articles , date of last access and so forth . * cite remaining unsupported statements . the tags put on this article seemed to be applied rather haphazardly ; i was able to address most of them using sources already provided in the article , and i'm sure more significant assertions passed unremarked . * remove weasel words . * remove or paraphrase text copied directly from us government website ( unfortunately , the reviewer didn't say where this text was ) . i think that's about everything .

: technically , from joe robbie's death in january of 1990 until elizabeth robbie's death on november 5 , 1991 , she was also a majority owner of the team . wayne huizenga , who had bought a 15% interest in the team and the new stadium , had first dibs ( is that a legal term ? ) on purchasing the team from the children heirs when their burden of estate taxes ( 47 million on 200 million in assets ) came due . so , you could list not only elizabeth robbie , but also the children as owners at different points prior to huizenga's purchase .

= = concerning ms. rees and miss universe organization/donald trump ... = = as far as i'm concerned , donald trump is a hypocrite and has shown that he holds double standards . i mean , at ms. conner's press conference , he said he was all for 2nd chances . then , ms. rees comes along , asking for just that , a 2nd chance . i mean , what conner did was way worse than what ms. rees did .
