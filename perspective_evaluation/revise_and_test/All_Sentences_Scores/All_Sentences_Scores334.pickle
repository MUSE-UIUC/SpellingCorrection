(S":::::: more ridiculous wikilawyering ( as in misinterpreting policy or relying on technicalities to justify inappropriate actions ) , precisely what you accuse others of doing , with internal inconsistency being the latest straw you're clutching to . you can not posit the sources aren't solid enough by offering the fact they also use prso's nickname in addition to his real name as a supposed proof of their lack of solidity . ludicrous . the fact that prso mostly goes by his nickname , dado , does not make his real first name , miladin , non-existent . and his real name being miladin is backed up by numerous reliable sources . the fact that sources mentioning prso's real name miladin also use his nickname dado is a inconsistent only in your world . no one disputes he mostly goes by dado . :::::: you've been removing verified info from dado prso over the span of 8 years already ( whilst with a straight face characterizing the work of other editors ' as harping ) , standing guard against , and i quote , serb nationalist talking points , a thinly veiled political advocacy , and an unverified serbian name claim . :::::: not to mention accusing people of wp : point . precious . i guess including information backed up by reliable sources qualifies as proving a point in your little world . :::::: there are hundreds , if not thousands , examples of wiki blps titled according to the person's nickname , and all of them have the the person's real first name included in the lede : :::::: * co adriaanse ( jacobus co adriaanse ) :::::: * sol campbell ( sulzeer jeremiah sol campbell ) :::::: * alex ferguson ( alexander chapman alex ferguson ) :::::: * matt busby ( alexander matthew matt busby ) :::::: * jupp heynckes ( josef jupp heynckes ) :::::: * ruud van nistelrooy ( rutgerus johannes martinus ruud van nistelrooy ) :::::: * marco van basten ( marcel marco van basten ) :::::: * uli hoene\xc3\x9f ( ulrich uli hoene\xc3\x9f) :::::: * toe blake ( joseph hector toe blake ) :::::: * cotton fitzsimmons ( lowell cotton fitzsimmons ) , and so on , and so forth ( just to keep it to the sportspeople ) :::::: somehow i don't see any sign of you over the last 8 years on any of those bios , removing the individuals ' first names from their articles ' respective ledes nor are you spewing any of your wikilawyering nonsense on those article's talk pages , complaining that the real name sources are internally inconsistent ( btw , most of the bios don't even provide sources for the first name information ) or pointing out that the person's nickname is more widely used than his first name as basis to remove the first name from the lede . :::::: also , whatever happened to that earlier claim of yours about including dado prso's real name in his bio constituting thinly veiled political advocacy , and an unverified serbian name claim ? considering there are numerous non-serb sources stating dado prso's real name to be miladin , do you still see it as a serb nationalist effort ? :::::: so to recap . there are reliable sources meeting wp : blp criteria under wp : source and wp : newsorg as ' factual content ' ( including a well-established news agency with numerous reprints ) that explicitly state his real name is miladin . no amount of wikilawyering from your end can change this basic fact ."
