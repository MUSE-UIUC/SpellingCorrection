a(S"sources people , no propaganda the following comments have been deleted : the band promotes croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism , and sings about topics such as the love for one's country , family and religion , but also about the hatred of serbs and croatian social democrats . dealing with such topics has made the band controversial . perkovi\xc4\x87 has been known to openly promote usta\xc5\xa1a ideology because he wears black clothes , salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the usta\xc5\xa1e and the ndh in his statements to the media . ultra-nationalism ? ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation . while patriotism means that you love your own nation , but you respect others . where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations ? and no mentioning songs created in time of war against the serbs , because it was the time of war . and only mention songs written by him . not what he is accused of performing . hatred toward sdp ? where ? name source . he is right wing , that si widely known . of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for croatia , but hatred ? reliable source please . where does he promote openly ustashe ? citation please . because he wears black clothes ? are all rockers ustashe ? by this , rock ' n ' roll is equal fascism . he is a rock singer , of course he wears black clothes . salute he uses is an old salute of croatian nobles , that existed long before ustashe . despite this , his statements confirming his support for the usta\xc5\xa1e actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual nsdap equivalent ( he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the ndh , in various degrees , to the media on at least twenty occasions ) . his credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning ( or other legal action ) . again , i see that this is already discussed . feral is not reliable , its a tabloid . only reliable newspapers should be used . and these quotations in feral , while they may be true , there are no links to check the meaning , because they may be taken out of contest , and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contes t.t his is not reliable . and one more question . a couple of months ago i translated two perkovic's statements in jutarnji list and vecernji list . i've put relevant sources , links to that articles . and a picture was there also . someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page . this is not what wikipedia is about . any change must be explained . shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods ."
