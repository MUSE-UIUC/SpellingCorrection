a(S"this is the last time i am going to tell you : stop vandalising and stop disturbing me family names are a valid article . each family name in every language can be an article . instead of your serbophobic ( and therefore racist , since you are apparently korean , at least that is what you claim ) vandalism edits , go and do something useful like making wiki articles for korean family names . most certainly do not ever again take the liberty to tell me what to do , because you have neither right nor authority to do that and your snotty and inappropriate comments are unwelcome . eventually , as i have already replied at the ludicrous discussion you started where , btw , no one took your side i will create longer pages for each individual family name when i have time . they will be full articles in their own right . for now , leave the serbian family names alone and do not input vandalism redirects to specific people . people are people and they have their own article and names are names and they have their own articles as names , not as incidental necessity for redirection . further your comparison with the family name hitler is absolutely abhorrent , as all people who had that family name have changed it after ww ii , so that family name does indeed relate to only a signe person . and even so , it would still be possible to write an article about the family name as such , but it's not my interest , so i won't do it . however , writing such an article would be legitimate and such an article could exist as a wikipedia article . on the links that you have been posting on my page ( and which i am going to delete , because they are unnecessary on may talk page ) it says very clearly : may and not must . are you really incapable of comprehending the difference between the two ? if you are , stop editing wikipedia altogether because all your edits are likely to be violation of rules . and , i repeat : do not come to scribble nonsense on my wall again . i have nothing to tell you that i haven't told you three times already and i do not want your inconsequential silly musings on my wall . go away !!"
