(S"amandajm : ignorant muslim & disgusting anti-white racist reading back on racist , amandajm - i've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name , he veritably hates white people . he deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences . why he does this should be the subject of debate . my theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim . also , it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations . this is well documented in psychiatric circles . why a dirty , white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is way beyond me . if he wants to write about muslim history , he should . but , he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and does not pertain to him . this guy is not european . honestly , he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all . ' stay on your side of the fence ' , is a motto i always quote . to that , yesterday i followed up by sending emails to homeland security and the fbi counter-terrorism division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are . ( no , i've not gone off the deep end ) . i received an automatic response email from the fbi stating that they will look into the matter , and will definitley be following up . racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the us . also , i sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans . i got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god ! his place in wiki - and in the us - shouldn't be secure ."
