a(S"- from someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now . ( and i contributed a lot in a short time and would have contributed so much more had i continued . things that i did : huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free ( placed pd ) on subjects ( often providing the only pics , to this day , on the subjects in question ) , hundreds of pages formatted according to standards , huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected ( in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it ) etc . etc . ) - and instead of helping me and being civil , sensible and using common sense you were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who ( for no apparent reason ) started a campaign of open violent threats , death threats , spamming and vandalism on me . you were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me , trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation , by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc . - against most other moderators ( private ) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject . your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you . apparently you felt that since you had read it , everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter , or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it , no regard for that individuals contributions , no regard for civility - and most of all , with no common sense applied whatsoever . it's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete , indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years , and the fun is over for most people - as , the most brutal blow of all , moderators such as you have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave . they simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior , because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here , because of people like you , and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here . it's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more ocd nerds who are already admins , and you're just a wannabe . good **** ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time , the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm . nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job , from people such as you . for example , the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006 , and since that they have ... well . remained in the same form as the core contributors left them , as they left this site . no updates . i'm truly not the only one to eject . not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over , if you ever need any help . it's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too , but given your attitude back then , i'm not surprised you did . after all , there were some decent admins here back then ( such as ) , and i'm sure there's a few now , but way too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives , and they have to show it , and snoop their noses everywhere . but like i said , as even admins are dropping out , what do you think happened to the contributors ? many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit , because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details , and newbies or worse , malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant . admins will be happy to see updates to the page , but the fact is , most of the updates today are degenerating the pages , obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage . and too bad you didn't quit a year ago , i might still be here , and there would probably be several thousands of lines , and few hundred articles more , along with maybe ~ 1000 more photographs . good riddance !!"
