a(S"hi again , i've done some google searches , and it seems that the term mad mel is a nickname used to describe her either on blogs or in the comments sections of blogs within the context of really quite foul attacks on her mad mel\xe2\x80\x99s a raving fuckwad etc etc . yes these are sources , but extremely unreliable ones . it actually looks as though the two sources above may be the best , but there are still problems with those . i still think the term should be avoided as a clear ad hominem attack and a clear violation of blp . i also think that the term is used by people who are made to feel uncomfortable by the challenging questions that she raises , and rather than engage her on those questions , they resort to cheap insults , but that is just my suspicion , and not entirely relevant here . cheers ,"
