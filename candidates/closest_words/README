===========================================

How to Use:

(1) If you have not done so, run "import nltk" and "nltk.download()" in Python console. In the pop-up window, select "Corpora" and select "words" to install.
(2) use the program in this way:

from closest_words import close_matches

then you can use the function "close_matches". The main function inside closest_words.py gives an example of using this function. Its documentation is given below:

    cutoff0 - (optional, default: 0.6) the cutoff above which closest matches 
             are found for each incorrect word

    Closest_Words - a list of closest matches to the input word
