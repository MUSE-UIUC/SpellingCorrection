closest_words_RWSE.py: 
this program
(1) reads input file in RWSE data format, see 
https://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/spelling-correction/rwse-datasets/
(2) for each misspelled word, find a list of possible corrections
(3) outputs all sentences, and for each sentence, outputs the indice of the 
misspelled word in it, and a list of possible corrections
(4) Dataset Referrence:

===========================================

How to Use:

(1) If you have not done so, run "import nltk" and "nltk.download()" in Python console. In the pop-up window, select "Corpora" and select "words" to install.
(2) use the program in this way:

from closest_words_RWSE import possible_corrections

then you can use the function "possible_corrections". The main function inside closest_words_RWSE.py gives an example of using this function. Its documentation is given below:

Read RWSE data file and then find closest words for each incorrect word
input:
    in_file_name - the name of the input file in RWSE data format
    num_data - (optional, default: 1000) the number of data that this program processes
    n0 - (optional, default: 3) the max number of closest matches that is found 
        for each incorrect word
    cutoff0 - (optional, default: 0.6) the cutoff above which closest matches 
             are found for each incorrect word
    outfile1 - (optional, default: 0) the name of the output file that stores
               the list Sentences_And_Idx
    outfile2 - (optional, default: 0) the name of the output file that stores
               the list of list Closest_Words
    outfile3 - (optional, default: 0) the name of the output file that stores
               the list Correct_Words           
output:
    Sentences_And_Idx - the list of tuples of (sentences, idx) in order.
                        idx is the 0-indexed position of the incorrect word 
                        appearing in the sentence
    Closest_Words - a list of list of closest matches to each incorrect word
    Correct_Words - the list of correct words in order
effect:
    outfile1 - the output file that stores the list Sentences_And_Idx
    outfile2 - the output file that stores the list of list Closest_Words
    outfile3 - the output file that stores the list Correct_Words
    console output - prints the progess of this function completed
