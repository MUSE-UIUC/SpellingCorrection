Files:

closest_edit_distance.py: 
This program finds a list of closest words for each input word in terms of edit distance

corpus_util.py:
Contains various functions that prepare a vocabulary as the format of dictionary

dict.pickle:
A vocabulary as the format of dictionary stored in pickle format.

===========================================

Requirements:

1. Python 2
(note that Python 3 will encounter errors at pickle)

2. editdistance package is installed
(pip install editdistance)

3. To run the function "closest_words_edit_distance_pickle", the file dict.pickle must be in the same folder as closest_edit_distance.py

===========================================

Functions:

1. closest_words_edit_distance(word, vocab, cutoff=1)

- use in this way:

from closest_edit_distance import closest_words_edit_distance

then you can use the function "closest_words_edit_distance". Its documentation is given below:

Find a list of closest words for each input word in terms of edit distance
input:
    word - input word
    vocab - the vocabulary that is used, in dictionary format
    cutoff - (optional, default: 1) the cutoff edit distance below which closest matches 
             are found     
output:
    Closest_Words - a list of closest matches to the input word


---------------------------------------------


2. closest_words_edit_distance_pickle(word, cutoff=1)

- use in this way:

from closest_edit_distance import closest_words_edit_distance_pickle

then you can use the function "closest_words_edit_distance_pickle". The main function inside closest_edit_distance.py gives an example of using this function. Its documentation is given below:

Find a list of closest words for each input word in terms of edit distance, 
using a "dict.pickle" file in the same folder as vocabulary
input:
    word - input word
    cutoff - (optional, default: 1) the cutoff edit distance below which closest matches 
             are found     
output:
    Closest_Words - a list of closest matches to the input word
